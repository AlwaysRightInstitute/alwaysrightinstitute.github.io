The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) 
coming with Swift 5.5 / Xcode 13 now supports the
[`@main`](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/what-does-main-do-in-swift-5.3/)
attribute.
We can use that to build apps using just SwiftPM, no Xcode involved!
Let's use it to build a
[Cowtastic](https://zeezide.de/en/products/codecows/index.html) app!

The
[`@main`](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/what-does-main-do-in-swift-5.3/)
attribute was actually introduced in Xcode 12, but starting w/ Swift 5.5
it is now also supported in Swift Package Manager.
(ObjC.io also has a nice pre-`@main`
 [article](https://www.objc.io/blog/2020/05/19/swiftui-without-an-xcodeproj/)
 about this, requiring more boilerplate.)

This is what is possible now, w/o having to use Xcode:
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup { 
      Text("Hello World!").padding()
    }
  }
}
```
Produces this little thing when it is run:
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/hello-world.png" /></center>


## Setting up the SwiftPM Boilerplate

> Unfortunately the otherwise awesome
> [swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh)
> does not yet support `@main`.
> [Issue #163](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh/issues/163) got filed.
> Once that is implemented, even SwiftPM can be completely avoided and
> Swift scripts w/ SwiftUI would just work.

For now, we still need to create a Swift package.
First make sure that Swift 5.5 is active:
```bash
$ swift --version
swift-driver version: 1.26.9 Apple Swift version 5.5 (swiftlang-1300.0.29.102 clang-1300.0.28.1)
Target: arm64-apple-macosx11.0
```

If it is not: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app`.

Next create the package boilerplate:
```bash
$ mkdir Tows && cd Tows
$ swift package init --type executable
Creating executable package: Tows
Creating Package.swift
Creating README.md
Creating .gitignore
Creating Sources/
Creating Sources/Tows/main.swift
Creating Tests/
Creating Tests/TowsTests/
Creating Tests/TowsTests/TowsTests.swift
```

This needs to be massaged a little more.
First we need to **rename** the **`main.swift`** to something else. 
`main.swift` is a special file which essentially wraps the whole content in
a big function (i.e. you can run statements like `print("Moo!")` at the top
level). This clashes with how `@main` works.

```bash
$ mv Sources/Tows/main.swift \
     Sources/Tows/Tows.swift
```

Then we need to replace the contents (the `print("Hello")`) with our
app as shown above:
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup { 
      Text("Hello World!").padding()
    }
  }
}
```

And then we can run `swift build`:
```bash
$ swift build
Tows.swift:3:1: error: 'main()' is only available in macOS 11.0 or newer
@main
^
```
Oops. That says at least macOS *BS* is required. Easily fixed by adding that
requirement to our `Package.swift` file:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Tows",
  platforms: [ .macOS(.v11) ], // <= add this!
  dependencies: [],
  targets: [ .executableTarget(name: "Tows", dependencies: []) ]
)
```
Now it builds and runs:
```bash
$ swift run
[3/3] Build complete!
```
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/hello-world.png" /></center>

You may have to search for the window, it is not put in front of your
other windows.

**IMPORTANT**: This is not quite a full app yet. 
You'll notice it has no menu bar and if you quit it, you'll quit your editor
instead üòà
To close it, you need to Control-C the `swift run` in the terminal.


## Fixing the App Activation

To make the thing behave like an app proper
a Cocoa with Love 
[trick](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/09/minimalist-cocoa-programming.html)
from 2010 has to be applied.
We are going to add an `init` to our `App` structure:
```swift
@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  init() {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
      NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
      NSApp.windows.first?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }    
  }
  ...
}
```

Re-run the tool, it'll have a menu proper and it can be quit as usual.

We are done. That is all which is required. But can we write more complex apps
with that? Something [cowtastic](https://zeezide.de/en/products/codecows/)?
Yes we can!

## A Cowtastic App

This thing, as a SwiftPM tool, in 82 lines of code 
(including support for search, selection and dragging):

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/compucow.png" /></center>

We are going to use the Swift
[cows](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows)
package, let's add it as a dependency to `Package.swift`:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Tows",
  platforms: [ .macOS(.v11) ],
  dependencies: [ // add this:
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows",
             from: "1.0.10")
  ],
  targets: [ 
    .executableTarget(name: "Tows", 
                      dependencies: [ "cows" ]) // <= add this!
  ]
)
```

And the script itself.
Gist: [Tows.swift](https://gist.github.com/helje5/df0e7306229d5b6439972d9a43b70321)
```swift
import SwiftUI
import cows // @AlwaysRightInstitute

struct ContentView: View {
  
  @State var searchString  = ""
  @State var matches       = allCows
  @State var selectedCow   : String?
  
  let font = Font(NSFont
    .monospacedSystemFont(ofSize: NSFont.systemFontSize, weight: .regular))
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      ScrollView {
        TextField("Search", text: $searchString)
          .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
          .padding(8)
          .onChange(of: searchString) { nv in
            matches = nv.isEmpty 
                    ? cows.allCows 
                    : cows.allCows.filter { $0.contains(searchString) }
          }
        Spacer()
      }
      
      ScrollView {
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
          if matches.isEmpty {
            Text("Didn't find cows matching '\(searchString)' üêÆ")
              .padding()
              .font(.title)
            Divider()
          }
          
          ForEach(matches.isEmpty ? allCows : matches, id: \.self) { cow in
            Text(verbatim: cow)
              .font(font)
              .onDrag { NSItemProvider(object: cow as NSString ) }
              .padding()
              .background(
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
                  .strokeBorder()
                  .foregroundColor(.accentColor)
                  .padding(4)
                  .opacity(selectedCow == cow ? 1 : 0)
              )
              .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
              .contentShape(Rectangle())
              .onTapGesture {
                selectedCow = selectedCow == cow ? nil : cow
              }
          }
        }
      }
      .ignoresSafeArea()
    }
  }
}

@main
struct TestAppApp: App {
  
  init() {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
      NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
      NSApp.windows.first?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }
  }
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .frame(minWidth: 640, minHeight: 320)
    }
    .windowStyle(HiddenTitleBarWindowStyle())
  }
}
```


## Closing Notes

The only thing we'd like is [swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh)
support, so that we can drop all that SwiftPM boilerplate ü§ì

There is [CodeCows](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecows/id1176112058).
Which (amongst other things) features an Xcode extension (yes!) and support for 
macOS services (i.e. automatic ASCII Cows support in any Cocoa text field, 
Electron not).

And for iOS there is 
[ASCII Cows](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/ascii-cows/id1176152684).
Includes a Messages app and proper Markdown support, so that you can paste
the cows into WhatsApp properly.
