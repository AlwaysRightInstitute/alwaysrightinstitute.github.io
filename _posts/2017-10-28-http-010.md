The Swift [Server APIs Project](https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/)
is an effort the provide a common HTTP implementation to
be used in the various Swift application server frameworks (Kitura, Perfect
and so on).
The ARI shows you how to use it on either macOS or Linux.

## HTTP Server API 0.1.0

On October 2nd, 2017, [Chris Bailey](https://github.com/seabaylea) of IBM announced the
[Swift Server API v0.1.0](https://github.com/swift-server/http/tree/0.1.0):

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HTTP server v0.1.0 from the Swift Server APIs project now available. Time to kick the tires and provide feedback!<a href="https://t.co/MfUm8oketx">https://t.co/MfUm8oketx</a></p>&mdash; Chris Bailey (@Chris__Bailey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey/status/914925288240316416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>

This is a small tutorial on how to use the API to write a small HTTP endpoint
in Swift.

HTTP 0.1.0 is the first result of the Server API working group and is based on a
[proposal by Johannes Weiß](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-server-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170403/000422.html) of Apple.
It provides a *very basic API* to implement an HTTP server in Swift.
*Don't expect a full fledged web framework*, it provides just the basics to 
handle HTTP requests.

This post tries to explain how to actually use it.
Before we start, the project provides nice Jazzy generated
[API documentation](https://swift-server.github.io/http/),
you may want to keep it open.

## Step 0: Requirements

The [HTTP 0.1.0 API](https://github.com/swift-server/http/tree/0.1.0)
is shipped as a 
[Swift Package Manager 4](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SPM)
package. This means you need to have Swift 4 installed, e.g. on macOS
using [Xcode 9](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
To play on Linux you can either download 
[Swift 4 tarballs](https://swift.org/download/),
or just use the official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/swift/)
(you can also use my 
[helje5/swift-dev](https://hub.docker.com/r/helje5/swift-dev/) image,
which comes w/ Emacs, etc).

> When using a Docker image, don't forget to start it with a port exposed,
> like so: 
> `docker run -p 1337:1337 -it --name sssfun helje5/swift-dev /bin/bash`

We start out working in the shell (Terminal.app on macOS) - 
but if you want, you can switch to Xcode soon.

## Step 1: Setup Hello World Package

OK, lets starts with a very simple Hello World service, which you can hit using
[http://localhost:1337/hello](http://localhost:1337/hello).

Once you have Swift 4, you can start creating the Swift package. 
First create a directory, then initialize it:

    mkdir sssfun && cd sssfun
    swift package init --type executable
      Creating executable package: sssfun
      Creating Package.swift
      Creating README.md
      Creating .gitignore
      Creating Sources/
      Creating Sources/sssfun/main.swift
      Creating Tests/

This creates a basic Hello World tool, you can build and run it:

    swift build
      Compile Swift Module 'sssfun' (1 sources)
      Linking ./.build/x86_64-unknown-linux/debug/sssfun
      
    .build/*/debug/sssfun
      Hello, world!

OK, great. We have a working Swift package.
If you want to use Xcode, Swift Package Manager can now generate an Xcode
project for you:

    swift package generate-xcodeproj
      generated: ./sssfun.xcodeproj
    
    open sssfun.xcodeproj # and Xcode should open

> Within Xcode, make sure you select the right scheme when trying to build and
> run the tool!

# Step 2: Add HTTP 0.1.0 as a Dependency

Within our `sssfun` package, you'll find the `Package.swift` file. In there
we need to tell SPM that we want to use the HTTP API package.
Open the file in either Xcode or Emacs, and add the dependency lines as shown:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "sssfun",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/http", 
                 from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "sssfun",
            dependencies: [ "HTTP" ])
    ]
)
```

This tells SPM that we want to use the HTTP-API (living on GitHub). And then
we tell it that our `sssfun` tool, needs the `HTTP` library within that package.
We also need to specify the API version (0.1.0 in this case).

Call `swift build` again, it should now download the dependency and build it:

    swift build
      Fetching https://github.com/swift-server/http
      Cloning https://github.com/swift-server/http
      Resolving https://github.com/swift-server/http at 0.1.0
      Compile CHTTPParser http_parser.c
      Compile Swift Module 'HTTP' (11 sources)
      Compile Swift Module 'sssfun' (1 sources)
      Linking ./.build/x86_64-unknown-linux/debug/sssfun
      
> Xcode users: Everytime you change the `Package.swift`
> you need to recreate the Xcode project using: 
> `swift package generate-xcodeproj`

Excellent. Now we are getting somewhere!

Lets create a new file - we can call it `HelloHTTP.swift` - in the
`Sources/sssfun` folder.
You can do this in Emacs/vi (`emacs Sources/sssfun/HelloHTTP.swift`), 
or in Xcode, however you like:

```swift
// File: Sources/sssfun/HelloHTTP.swift
import Foundation
import HTTP
 
func hello(request: HTTPRequest, response: HTTPResponseWriter ) 
       -> HTTPBodyProcessing 
{        
    response.writeHeader(status: .ok) 
    response.writeBody("Hello, World!\n") 
    response.done() 
    return .discardBody 
} 
```

This is our HTTP request handling function. It gets passed in the 
`HTTPRequest`
and the
`HTTPResponseWriter`.
It has to return instructions how the API is supposed to handle request
content (e.g. a file upload). In this case, we just drop any content that
is sent (we return `.discardBody`).

The `HTTPRequest` has properties for the method (e.g. GET or POST),
the target (the URL the request is working on, e.g. `/hello`),
HTTP request headers (e.g. `User-Agent`),
as well as the HTTP protocol version.

The `HTTPResponseWriter` we get allows us to send data back to the client, i.e.
deliver the response content.
In our case we just say `.ok` (HTTP `200` status code),
write out some text,
and then mark the response as `.done()`.

Very nice. So this is the Hello World of HTTP API.
But there is one piece missing, we need to setup the server running our
handler function.
To do that, we are going to edit `Sources/sssfun/main.swift`.
Right now, this contains the `print("Hello World")` as generated by SPM.
Replace that code with the HTTP 0.1.0 sample server:

```swift
// File: Sources/sssfun/main.swift
import Foundation
import HTTP

let server = HTTPServer()
do {
    try server.start(port: 1337, handler: hello)
}
catch {
    print("failed to start server:", error)
    exit(42)
}

RunLoop.current.run()
```
We create the server object, start it at port `1337`. Then we start the
Runloop, which is responsible for coordinating the access to the server
sockets. That `run()` call will never complete (stop the server in Xcode,
or use Ctrl-C in the shell).

That's it. Call `swift build` and re-run the tool (or just press Run in Xcode):

    swift build
      Compile Swift Module 'sssfun' (2 sources)
      Linking ./.build/x86_64-unknown-linux/debug/sssfun
    
    .build/*/debug/sssfun
      Started server on port 1337 with 4 serial queues 
      of each type and 8 accept sockets

The server is now running and accepting requests.
You can hit it using [http://localhost:1337/hello](http://localhost:1337/hello)
and it should display `Hello World`:

  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sss-sample/sss-1-hello-world.png" 
  /></center>

> Xcode users: If you see stops in the Xcode debugger related to `SIGPIPE`,
> create a file `~/.lldbinit` with this content:<br />
> `process handle SIGPIPE -n true -p true -s false`. Restart Xcode.

# Step 3: Cows. Lots of them. 🐄🐂🐄

All this is nice, but pretty boring, isn't it? Let's add some beef!
We are going to use the Swift
[cows](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows)
module.

Reopen the `Package.swift` file, and add the cows package and the cows
module (Xcode users rerun `swift package generate-xcodeproj` after doing this):
```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "sssfun",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/http",
                 from: "0.1.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git",
                 from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "sssfun",
            dependencies: [ "HTTP", "cows" ]),
    ]
)
```

Next we'll add beef to our `HelloHTTP.swift` endpoint in the
`Sources/sssfun` folder.

```swift
// File: Sources/sssfun/HelloHTTP.swift
import Foundation
import HTTP
import cows

func hello(request: HTTPRequest, response: HTTPResponseWriter )
     -> HTTPBodyProcessing
{
    response.writeHeader(status: .ok, 
                         headers: [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
    response.writeBody(
        """
        <h1>cows</h1>
        <center><pre>\(vaca().htmlEscaped)</pre></center>
        """
    )
    response.done()
    return .discardBody
}

extension String {
    var htmlEscaped : String {
        return map { escapeMap[$0] ?? String($0) }.reduce("", +)
    }
}
let escapeMap : [ Character : String ] = [
    "<" : "&lt;", ">": "&gt;", "&": "&amp;", "\"": "&quot;"
]
```

This is a little more difficult and shows that HTTP API only provides very
basic stuff. It doesn't deal with HTML or anything - 
that would be the responsibility of a higher level framework
(like Kitura, Vapor, etc).
For example we need to escape some characters to make the cows render as proper
HTML.

Build and re-run the thing, then hit
[http://localhost:1337/hello](http://localhost:1337/hello)
and reload the page as often as you like. You should get plenty of cows
delivered to your browser.

  /></center>

# Step 4: Reinventing Google

Sure, random cows are just great and always carry a surprise.
But lets add a way to search for specific cows.
Again, you'll see that you need to do some stuff manually, which a higher level
framework would usually do for you. But we can get it done w/ a little code.

In the handler we add an HTML `form`,
we add helper functions to decode URL query parameters,
and we add the code to search for cows once we got a query string.

```swift
// File: Sources/sssfun/HelloHTTP.swift
import Foundation
import HTTP
import cows

func hello(request: HTTPRequest, response: HTTPResponseWriter )
     -> HTTPBodyProcessing
{
    let q   = request[query: "q"]?.lowercased() ?? ""
    let cow = q.isEmpty
        ? vaca() // random cow
        : allCows.first(where: { $0.lowercased().contains(q) }) 
          ?? "No such cow"
    
    response.writeHeader(status: .ok,
                         headers: [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
    response.writeBody(
        """
        <center>
          <form action="/hello/" method="get">
            Find Beef: <input name="q" placeholder="e.g. 'moon'">
            <a href="/hello/">[random]</a>
          </form>
          <pre>\(cow.htmlEscaped)</pre>
        </center>
        """
    )
    response.done()
    return .discardBody
}

// That can be put into a separate Helpers.swift file:

extension HTTPRequest {
    
    subscript(query q: String) -> String? {
        return urlQueryParameters.first(where: { $0.0 == q })?.1
    }
    
    var urlQueryParameters : [ (String, String) ] {
        return URL(string: target)?.query?.components(separatedBy: "&")
            .map {
                let pair = $0.split(separator: "=", maxSplits: 1).map(String.init)
                return ( pair.first?.removingURLQueryParameterEncoding ?? "",
                         pair.last? .removingURLQueryParameterEncoding ?? "" )
            } ?? []
    }
}

extension String {
    var htmlEscaped : String {
        return map { escapeMap[$0] ?? String($0) }.reduce("", +)
    }
    var removingURLQueryParameterEncoding : String {
        return replacingOccurrences(of: "+", with: " ")
               .removingPercentEncoding
               ?? "😰"
    }
}
let escapeMap : [ Character : String ] = [
  "<" : "&lt;", ">": "&gt;", "&": "&amp;", "\"": "&quot;"
]
```

Build and re-run the thing, then hit
[http://localhost:1337/hello](http://localhost:1337/hello).
Enter some query string, e.g. 'moon', 'lator', 'trouble' or 'night'.

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sss-sample/sss-3-google-cow.png" 
  /></center>

Very well.
We built a very basic HTTP service which competes with Google on search,
and also delivers pretty cows.


## Bonus: Use Apache to host your HTTP endpoint

So you are happy with our cows web service and want to deploy it on production.
But the 0.1.0 API server may not be quite there yet, 
and you really want HTTP/2, HTTPS and NTLM authentication for sure.

Fortunately the ARI hacked up an implementation of the very same Swift API
which allows you to run the exact same code in the 
*"The most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996"*:
[Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org).
We are going to use an Apache module called
[mod_swift](http://mod-swift.org)
and an implementation of the 
[HTTP API 0.1.0 for mod_swift](https://github.com/modswift/http/tree/implementation/mod_swift).

For the following we assume that you are on macOS w/
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
(The same should work fine on Linux, just checkout
the [mod_swift Installation](http://docs.mod-swift.org/install/)
to get going, and please let us know if you run into issues).

If you don't have Homebrew yet, get it at: [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
(installation is a one liner).
Then install mod_swift, and maybe `httpd` w/ HTTP/2 support and threading:

    brew reinstall httpd --with-mpm-event --with-http2
    
    brew install mod_swift
    ==> Installing mod_swift from modswift/mod_swift
    🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/mod_swift/0.8.10: 25 files, 68.5KB, built in 5 seconds

To check whether it worked, call `swift apache validate`, like so:

    swift apache validate
      The Swift Apache build environment looks sound.

Neat. The next step is to replace the `Sources/sssfun/main.swift`,
which contains the API 0.1.0 test server w/ Apache.
Note that we keep using the `HelloHTTP.swift` w/o any changes!
We also need to clean the package:

    rm -rf .build Package.resolved
    rm Sources/sssfun/main.swift
    
Create a new file `ApacheMain.swift` in `Sources/sssfun`:

```swift
import Foundation
import HTTP

@_cdecl("ApacheMain")
public func ApacheMain(cmd: OpaquePointer) {
  let app = HTTP.apache(cmd, name: "mods_httpapi")
  app.use("/hello", hello)
}
```

Before we can build this, we need to replace the API dependency in
`Package.swift`.
Note that the module name is still the same, we just change the package
providing that HTTP module.
Replace this:

    .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/http",
             from: "0.1.0"),

with:

    .package(url: "https://github.com/modswift/http.git", 
             .branch("implementation/mod_swift")),

Now call `swift apache build`, which will create the Apache module for us:

    swift apache build

      Cloning https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git

      Compile Swift Module 'HTTP' (10 sources)
      Compile Swift Module 'cows' (3 sources)
      Compile Swift Module 'sssfun' (2 sources)

The start Apache:

    swift apache serve
      Note: DocRoot /usr/local/var/www (create a 'public' dir to use an own one)
      Starting Apache on port 8042/8442: // yes, a bug ;-)
      GET /hello 200 295 - 1ms
      GET /hello 200 654 - 0ms
      GET /hello/ 200 870 - 2ms

And hit is using:
[http://localhost:8042/hello](http://localhost:8042/hello).
Or hit it using HTTPS (self signed certificate):
[https://localhost:8442/hello](https://localhost:8442/hello).
If you are using Chrome and open the Developer Tools, you'll notice
it is talking HTTP/2 to the server (Protocol: h2).

## Summary

Looks like Server Side Swift is getting somewhere.
To get going with simple endpoints there is no need anymore to download
big application server packages with tons of dependencies anymore.
You can simply drop in the HTTP API package, that's it.
And if you have more complex needs,
[mod_swift](http://mod-swift.org) and 
[ApacheExpress](http://apacheexpress.io)
are there for you too.
