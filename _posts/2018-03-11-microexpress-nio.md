In a surprise move, Apple released
[swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
on March 1st.
Today we are going to have a look on how to use that Swift package,
and build a tiny but useful web framework along the way.
Say hello to ÂµExpress. *Again.*


> Update 2019-12-27: [A ÂµTutorial on Swift NIO 2](/microexpress-nio2/)
> is now available. Xcode 11 now includes some SPM support and SwiftNIO
> evolved to version 2.

Hey, but didn't we just [built ÂµExpress a month ago](/microexpress/),
using that offical
[HTTP API](https://github.com/swift-server/http/tree/0.1.0)
from the Swift
[Server APIs Work Group](https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/)?
Well, yes, we did.
But that API is history now,
[Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
fully replaces that effort:

So lets redo our micro framework using the new Swift NIO API!

**The goal**. Instead of providing a low level [Netty](https://netty.io)-like 
handler objects, 
we want to write a Swift HTTP endpoint 
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)-like,
using *middleware* and routing:

```swift
import MicroExpress

let app = Express()

app.get("/moo") { req, res, next in
  res.send("Muhhh")
}
app.get("/json") { _, res, _ in
  res.json([ "a": 42, "b": 1337 ])
}
app.get("/") { _, res, _ in
  res.send("Homepage")
}

app.listen(1337)
```

We also throw in support for JSON.
And all that with just a Âµscopic amount of code.
The final package has a little more than **350 lines of code**
(as if that would say anything).<br>
You think you need that `[insert the latest hype]` framework?
Quite likely it is just monolithic bloat and you don't.


## First: What is Swift NIO?

> [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/README.md)
> is a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application 
> framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol 
> servers & clients.
>
> It's like [Netty](https://netty.io), but written for Swift.

It is what?
Well, it is a toolkit to write Internet servers (and clients) of various kinds.
Those can be 
[web servers](https://github.com/NozeIO/swift-nio-irc-webclient) (HTTP),
mail servers (IMAP4/SMTP),
[Redis servers](https://github.com/NozeIO/redi-s),
[IRC chat servers](https://github.com/NozeIO/swift-nio-irc-server), etc.
It is built with a focus on very high performance and scalability.

As a regular HTTP-toolkit developer, who uses stuff along the lines of
Rails or Node, you usually do not care about directly interfacing with 
Swift NIO.
It becomes relevant if you are
adding a completely new protocol,
add some common network level functionality 
(like rate limiters, content compressors, XSLT renderers, etc.),
have a very performance sensitive endpoint,
or want to **build an own web framework**. Hey, the latter is us!

In other words: Swift NIO is a rather low level API, 
somewhat similar to the Apache 2 module API.

To implement our web framework, we are going to create those components:

1. an [app object](#step-1-application-class) running the server
2. a [request](#21-incomingmessage) and 
   a [response](#22-serverresponse) object
3. [middleware](#step-31-middleware) and a router
4. fun stuff

There is a little setup overhead before we can actually see something,
but not *that* much - a few files, it is Âµ - so stick with us.
And if you are really lazy and just want to follow along,
you can clone the 
[finished project at GitHub](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/tree/branches/swift-nio)
ðŸ¤“

## Step 0: Prepare the Xcode Project

<a href="https://swiftxcode.github.io" target="extlink"><img src="http://zeezide.com/img/SwiftXcodePkgIcon.svg"
     align="right" width="86" height="86" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" /></a>
Instead of fiddling around with Swift Package Manager,
we use 
[swift xcode](https://swiftxcode.github.io)
to use the package directly within Xcode.
Grab [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it yet, and install the 
[Swift NIO image](https://github.com/SwiftXcode/SwiftNIO_XcodeImage)
using:

```shell
brew install swiftxcode/swiftxcode/swift-xcode-nio
swift xcode link-templates
```

Within Xcode, create a new project (âŒ˜-Shift-N), and select the
"Swift-NIO" template:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/microexpress-nio/01-new-project-template-type.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/microexpress-nio/01-new-project-template-type-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>

Give it a name, e.g. "MicroExpress".
**Make sure that the "Generate Server Boilerplate" option is unchecked**,
and the the 
"Include SwiftNIO HTTP1 module" is option is checked
(do not check the ÂµExpress option, this is for including
 the finished ÂµExpress framework, which we are about to build):

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/microexpress-nio/02-new-project-no-boilerplate-named.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/microexpress-nio/02-new-project-no-boilerplate-named-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>
  
Build the project.


## Step 1: Application Class

The primary purpose of the `Express` application class is 
starting and running the  HTTP server. This part (add it to the main.swift):

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[main.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/1-hello-world/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/main.swift)
```swift
// File: main.swift - Add to existing file
let app = Express()

app.listen(1337)
```

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/1-hello-world/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

import Foundation
import NIO
import NIOHTTP1

open class Express {
  
  let loopGroup = 
        MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: System.coreCount)
  
  open func listen(_ port: Int) {
    let reuseAddrOpt = ChannelOptions.socket(
                         SocketOptionLevel(SOL_SOCKET),
                         SO_REUSEADDR)
    let bootstrap = ServerBootstrap(group: loopGroup)
      .serverChannelOption(ChannelOptions.backlog, value: 256)
      .serverChannelOption(reuseAddrOpt, value: 1)
      
      .childChannelInitializer { channel in
        channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline()
        
        // this is where the action is going to be!
      }
      
      .childChannelOption(ChannelOptions.socket(
                            IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY), value: 1)
      .childChannelOption(reuseAddrOpt, value: 1)
      .childChannelOption(ChannelOptions.maxMessagesPerRead, 
                          value: 1)
    
    do {
      let serverChannel = 
            try bootstrap.bind(host: "localhost", port: port)
                         .wait()
      print("Server running on:", serverChannel.localAddress!)
      
      try serverChannel.closeFuture.wait() // runs forever
    }
    catch {
      fatalError("failed to start server: \(error)")
    }
  }
}
```

Build and run this, and the console should say:
```
Server running on: [IPv6]::1:1337``
```
That can be connected via
[http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337/),
but it won't generate responses yet.

### Discussion

The first thing it does is create a
[MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoop.swift#L641):
```swift
let loopGroup = 
      MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: System.coreCount)
```

A Swift NIO 
[EventLoop](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoop.swift#L54)
is pretty much the same like a
[DispatchQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue).
It handles IO events,
one can queue blocks to it for later execution (like `DispatchQueue.async`),
you can schedule a timer (like `DispatchQueue.asyncAfter`).<br>
The 
[MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoop.swift#L641)
is somewhat like a concurrent queue.
It is using multiple threads to distribute workload thrown at it.

The next thing is the `listen` function (dropping all the Java-ish boilerplate
to setup the common options):

```swift
open func listen(_ port: Int) {
  ...
  let bootstrap = ServerBootstrap(group: loopGroup)
    ...
    .childChannelInitializer { channel in
      channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline()
      // this is where the action is going to be!
    }
  ...
  let serverChannel = 
        try bootstrap.bind(host: "localhost", port: port)
                     .wait()
```


It uses the
[ServerBootstrap](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/Bootstrap.swift#L48)
object to setup and configure the "Server Channel".
The Bootstrap object is just a helper to perform the setup, after it is done,
it is done.

A Swift NIO
[Channel](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/Channel.swift#L88)
is similar to a Swift Foundation 
[FileHandle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filehandle).
It (usually) wraps a Unix file descriptor (socket, pipe, file, etc.),
and provides operations on top of it.

In this case we have a "Server Channel", that is, a passive socket which
is going to accept incoming connections.
The latter are again represented as
[Channel](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/Channel.swift#L88)
objects and are configured in the `childChannelInitializer` shown above.
The `channel` argument is the freshly setup connection to the client.

Channels maintain a 
[ChannelPipeline](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/ChannelPipeline.swift#L15),
which is simply a set of "handler" objects
(in a way they are not that different to Middleware).
They get executed in sequence and can transform the incoming and outgoing data,
or do other actions.

So far we call `channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline()`.
This adds handlers to the pipeline which:
transform the incoming data
(plain bytes) into higher level HTTP objects (i.e. requests),
and "render" outgoing HTTP objects (i.e. responses) back to bytes.
Which are then written back to the client.

Next we are going to add our own handler to that pipeline.


## Step 1b: Add an own NIO Handler

Our handler is going to receive HTTP request parts (because we put 
`configureHTTPServerPipeline` in the pipeline before us),
and it is going to send back HTTP to the client:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/1-hello-world/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L20)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - change the .childChannelInitializer call as shown

open class Express {
  ...
      .childChannelInitializer { channel in
        channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline().then {
          channel.pipeline.add(handler: HTTPHandler())
        }
      }
  ...
}
```

> If you are wondering about the `.then`, most functions in NIO return a
> [Future](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoopFuture.swift#L208).
> But lets ignore that part for now. Read it as:
> once `configureHTTPServerPipeline` completed, add our own handler.

We put the actual handler into the `Express` object:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/1-hello-world/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L45)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - insert at the bottom

open class Express {
  // other code
  
  final class HTTPHandler : ChannelInboundHandler {
    typealias InboundIn = HTTPServerRequestPart
    
    func channelRead(ctx: ChannelHandlerContext, data: NIOAny) {
      let reqPart = unwrapInboundIn(data)

      switch reqPart {
        case .head(let header):
          print("req:", header)

        // ignore incoming content to keep it micro :-)
        case .body, .end: break
      }
    }
  }
} // end of Express class  
```

You can build and run this, and target that server using 
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/).
It still won't generate a response yet, but you should see the incoming
request in the console:
```
Server running on: [IPv6]::1:1337``
req: HTTPRequestHead(method: NIOHTTP1.HTTPMethod.GET, uri: "/", ...)
```


### Discussion

Our handler is a
[ChannelInboundHandler](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/ade7eb1b37efc22e7cc0b961eb381110edd17a7b/Sources/NIO/TypeAssistedChannelHandler.swift#L36),
which means it receives incoming data from the client (web browser, curl, etc.).
The type of the data it expects is specified using the `InboundIn`
typealias (which refers a 
[generic associated type](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html)
of a Swift protocol):

```swift
typealias InboundIn = HTTPServerRequestPart
```

This means that the data we are going to receive/read are 
[HTTPServerRequestPart](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1/HTTPTypes.swift#L97)
items,
a Swift enum, with the cases 
`.head` (the HTTP request head),
`.body` (some body byte data) and
`.end`  (the request was fully read).

Those items is passed into the `channelRead` function when new data becomes
available:

```swift
func channelRead(ctx: ChannelHandlerContext, data: NIOAny) {
  let reqPart : HTTPServerRequestPart = unwrapInboundIn(data)
  ...
```

The data is passed around as `NIOAny` objects for efficiency reasons and
needs to be unwrapped.
Again: The data in there are `HTTPServerRequestPart` items, because the
`NIOHTTP1` handler sits in front of our handler in the channel pipeline.
It converts (parses) the HTTP bytes into a sequence of the HTTP enum values.

As a temporary measure, lets return some "Hello World" data to the browser,
add this to the .head section of the switch (below the `print`):

```swift
case .head(let header):
  print("req:", header)
  
  let head = HTTPResponseHead(version: header.version, 
                              status: .ok)
  let part = HTTPServerResponsePart.head(head)
  _ = ctx.channel.write(part)

  var buffer = ctx.channel.allocator.buffer(capacity: 42)
  buffer.write(string: "Hello Schwifty World!")
  let bodypart = HTTPServerResponsePart.body(.byteBuffer(buffer))
  _ = ctx.channel.write(bodypart)

  let endpart = HTTPServerResponsePart.end(nil)
  _ = ctx.channel.writeAndFlush(endpart).then {
    ctx.channel.close()
  }
```

Build and run this, and open
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/)
in your favorite web browser (IE 3.0.1).

The code section is doing what Express does in a:

```swift
response.send("Hello Schwifty World!")`
```

(we are going to put the code above in a matching method of our ServerResponse
 object).

A few points worth noting:
- We cannot just write back bytes to the channel. Just like we receive HTTP
  items, we need to send HTTP items (.head, .body and .end). The NGHTTP1
  handler is going to convert those to actual byte data on the socket.
- We call `.write` on the channel. That thing *does not actually write* data
  out to the socket. To send it to the socket, the channel must be *flushed*.
  Which is why we send the response `.end` via `writeAndFlush`.
- When sending byte data (the content of the response), Swift NIO usually
  expects us to use a
  [ByteBuffer](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/ByteBuffer-core.swift#L86).
  That thing is again very similar to a Foundation
  [Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data)
  object.
- The final detail is that we close the channel (aka connection) after the
  last `writeAndFlush`. But we cannot just immediately close the connection,
  because the writes may not have happend yet.
  Hence we attach to the 
  [Future](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoopFuture.swift#L208)
  returned by `writeAndFlush` and close the
  channel after that has completed (`then`).

### Summary: Step 1

We now have a working Hello World HTTP endpoint. We can receive requests
and return schwifty responses.
In the next step we are going to wrap that functionality in nice
`IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse`
objects.

Our `Express` application object can create a server *Channel*
to accept incoming connections using a *Bootstrap* object.
We add the `NIOHTTP1` handlers to the *Pipeline* of incoming client connections,
just before adding our own *Handler* to parse and emit typed HTTP protocol
items.


## Step 2: Request/Response objects

### 2.1 IncomingMessage

When our `Express.HTTPHandler` receives a HTTP `.head` item,
it passes over a 
[`HTTPRequestHead`](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1/HTTPTypes.swift#L22)
struct in an associated value of the enum case.
We are going to wrap that in an own `IncomingMessage` class.

The primary enhancement of this class is the `userInfo`
storage. The storage can later be used by middleware to pass along
data to subsequent middleware.

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[IncomingMessage.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/2-reqres/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/IncomingMessage.swift)
```swift
// File: IncomingMessage.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

import NIOHTTP1

open class IncomingMessage {

  public let header   : HTTPRequestHead // <= from NIOHTTP1
  public var userInfo = [ String : Any ]()
  
  init(header: HTTPRequestHead) {
    self.header = header
  }
}
```

> Why are we wrapping this instead of just using the API struct?
> For one, as a struct, 
> [`HTTPRequestHead`](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1/HTTPTypes.swift#L22)
> cannot be extended with
> additional stored properties (yet?).
> Which we need to associate more data w/ the request.
> Also, we are going to pass the request around a lot.
> Passing it around by reference is cheaper than copying

> Finally:
> [`HTTPRequestHead`](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1/HTTPTypes.swift#L22)
> represents just the HTTP header,
> *not* the actual HTTP message (i.e. not the body).

This is how you get the HTTP method, the request URL, and the User-Agent:
```swift
print("Method: \(request.header.method)")
print("URL:    \(request.header.uri)")
print("UA:     \(req.header.headers.first["User-Agent"] ?? "-")")
```
*(Feel free to add convenience properties/functions/subscripts to 
`IncomingMessage`,
 for this we want to keep it Âµ.)*


### 2.2 ServerResponse

The `ServerResponse` incorporates the same code we
used above in our "temporary measure" to send a "Hello World"
to the client.
On creation it gets passed in the associated *Channel*. It then emits the
appropriate HTTP items (.head, .body and .end).

Initially the primary function is an Express-like `send` method,
which writes the HTTP header, the response body, and closes the
response.

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[ServerResponse.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/2-reqres/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/ServerResponse.swift)
```swift
// File: ServerResponse.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

import NIO
import NIOHTTP1

open class ServerResponse {

  public  var status         = HTTPResponseStatus.ok
  public  var headers        = HTTPHeaders()
  public  let channel        : Channel
  private var didWriteHeader = false
  private var didEnd         = false
  
  public init(channel: Channel) {
    self.channel = channel
  }
  
  /// An Express like `send()` function.
  open func send(_ s: String) {
    flushHeader()

    let utf8   = s.utf8
    var buffer = channel.allocator.buffer(capacity: utf8.count)
    buffer.write(bytes: utf8)

    let part = HTTPServerResponsePart.body(.byteBuffer(buffer))
    
    _ = channel.writeAndFlush(part)
               .mapIfError(handleError)
               .map { self.end() }
  }
  
  /// Check whether we already wrote the response header.
  /// If not, do so.
  func flushHeader() {
    guard !didWriteHeader else { return } // done already
    didWriteHeader = true
    
    let head = HTTPResponseHead(version: .init(major:1, minor:1),
                                status: status, headers: headers)
    let part = HTTPServerResponsePart.head(head)
    _ = channel.writeAndFlush(part).mapIfError(handleError)
  }
  
  func handleError(_ error: Error) {
    print("ERROR:", error)
    end()
  }
  
  func end() {
    guard !didEnd else { return }
    didEnd = true
    _ = channel.writeAndFlush(HTTPServerResponsePart.end(nil))
               .map { self.channel.close() }
  }
}
```

> When encountering errors we just log and close the socket.
> You would probably want to add `onError` listeners here,
> similar to Noze.io.

How do you use it, simple:

```swift
response.send("Hello World!")
```

### 2.3 Hook them up to the HTTPHandler

Lets hook up our new `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects to the
`Express.HTTPHandler`.

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/2-reqres/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L52)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - replace the hello stuff w/ this code

case .head(let header):
  let request  = IncomingMessage(header: header)
  let response = ServerResponse(channel: ctx.channel)
  
  print("req:", header.method, header.uri, request)
  response.send("Way easier to send data!!!")
```

We don't use the request yet, but we can send data w/ much less effort.


### Discussion

The ServerResponse uses the `HTTPHeaders` struct and `HTTPResponseStatus` enum
from 
[NIOHTTP1](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1).
They do what their name says...

As mentioned we `init` the object with the 
[Channel](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/Channel.swift#L88),
this is where we are going to perform our writes on.
We discussed writes already, but lets review it again, this is what we do:

```swift
_ = channel.writeAndFlush(part)
           .mapIfError(handleError)
           .map { self.end() }
```

We pass the data into the `writeAndFlush` as `HTTPPart` items - 
a `.head` (status + headers), `.body` (response body) and `.end` (response end).
[NIOHTTP1](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIOHTTP1/HTTPEncoder.swift#L111)
will convert that to the actual HTTP/1.x protocol on the socket.

The `writeAndFlush` method works *asynchronously*, 
it just *enqueues* the part to be written,
and returns a so called
[Future](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoopFuture.swift#L208)
item.
To that `Future` you can attach a handler for the case 
[when errors happen](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoopFuture.swift#L514)
(`mapIfError(handleError`)
and for the case 
[when the operation was successful](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/1.1.0/Sources/NIO/EventLoopFuture.swift#L449)
(`map({ self.end())}`).<br />
Either one will be invoked when the write has completed or error'ed.
In ÂµExpress, like in Express, we tunnel the errors through a single error
handler. Which in our case just logs the error, and closes the connection. Âµ.


### Summary: Step 2

We encapsulated the rather complicated Swift NIO operations in neat,
Express like `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` classes.
Which we hooked up the the Setty HTTP handler object.

Yet the core functionality (sending "Hello World" to the world) is still
embedded deep within the `Express.HTTPHandler` object.


## Step 3: Middleware and Routing

### Step 3.1: Middleware

The term "middleware" has many meanings,
but in the context of 
[Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) /
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
it is simply a closure/function which can opt in to handle a HTTP request
(or not).

A middleware function gets a request, a response and
another function to call if it didn't (completely) handle
the request (`next`).
An example middleware function:

```swift
func moo(req  : IncomingRequest,
         res  : ServerResponse,
         next : @escaping Next)
{
  res.send("Moooo!")
}
```

Usually you don't write the middleware as a regular function,
but you pass it over as a trailing closure when adding it to
a router:
```swift
app.use { req, res, next in
  print("We got a request:", req)
  next() // do not stop here
}
```

In Swift a middleware can be expressed by a simple `typealias`:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Middleware.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Middleware.swift)
```swift
// File: Middleware.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

public typealias Next = ( Any... ) -> Void

public typealias Middleware =
                  ( IncomingMessage,
                    ServerResponse, 
                    @escaping Next ) -> Void
```

That's it. There is no magic to a middleware, it is just a simple
function!


### Step 3.2: Router

In real 
[Express](https://github.com/modswift/ExExpress)
there is a little more to it 
(e.g. [mounting](http://expressjs.com/de/api.html#app.mountpath)),
but for our purposes think of a router as a simple list of
middleware functions.
Middleware is added to that list using the `use()` function.

When handling a request, the router just steps through its list
of middleware until one of them **doesn't** call `next`.
And by that, finishes the request handling process.

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Router.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Router.swift)
```swift
// File: Router.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

open class Router {
  
  /// The sequence of Middleware functions.
  private var middleware = [ Middleware ]()

  /// Add another middleware (or many) to the list
  open func use(_ middleware: Middleware...) {
    self.middleware.append(contentsOf: middleware)
  }
  
  /// Request handler. Calls its middleware list
  /// in sequence until one doesn't call `next()`.
  func handle(request        : IncomingMessage,
              response       : ServerResponse,
              next upperNext : @escaping Next)
  {
    let stack = self.middleware
    guard !stack.isEmpty else { return upperNext() }
    
    var next : Next? = { ( args : Any... ) in }
    var i = stack.startIndex
    next = { (args : Any...) in
      // grab next item from matching middleware array
      let middleware = stack[i]
      i = stack.index(after: i)
      
      let isLast = i == stack.endIndex
      middleware(request, response, isLast ? upperNext : next!)
    }
    
    next!()
  }
}
```

> Note: This leaves out Error middleware.
> [ExExpress](https://github.com/modswift/ExExpress/blob/develop/Sources/ExExpress/express/Route.swift#L158)
> has an implementation of that,
> if you want to see how you might implement that part.

This doesn't do any actual routing yet ðŸ˜€, but we'll get to that soon!
How do you use it - as shown before:

```swift
router.use { req, res, next in
  print("We got a request:", req)
  next() // do not stop here
}
router.use { _, res, _ in
  res.send("hello!") // response is done.
}
router.use { _, _, _ in
  // we never get here, because the 
  // middleware above did not call `next`
}
```

### Discussion

The one non-obvious thing here is the `handle` method of the Router.
Why not just loop through the array and call the middleware directly,
like we did in the HTTP-API version of
[ÂµExpress](/microexpress/#step-3-router)?
What is that `next` closure thing?

Our ÂµExpress implementation of a Router can run completely asynchronously.
When a middleware runs, it does **not** have to call `next` immediately!
Which is also the reason why the `next` closure passed in is marked as
`@escaping`.<br>
To give an example,
a middleware delaying any incoming request by 2 seconds:

```swift
app.use { _, res, next in
  // run the closure/task in 2 seconds
  _ = res.channel.eventLoop.scheduleTask(in: .seconds(2)) {
    next()
  }
}
```

Notice how our call to `next` "escapes" the scope. It will run at an arbitrary
later time - and that while we are stepping through the Router's array of
middlewarez.
To solve that, our embedded `next` closures **captures** the current position
in the middleware array, as well as the array itself (in the `stack` variable):

```swift
var i = stack.startIndex    // <= CAPTURED
next = { ...
  let middleware = stack[i]
  i = stack.index(after: i) // <= SHARED
```

The `next` closure - and its captured state - is shared between all invocations.
When it gets called, it advances the index attached to it, and thereby moves
forward in the middleware stack.

**Important**: Never do this in any asynchronous Express implementation
(or Swift NIO handler for that matter):

```swift
app.use { _, res, next in
  sleep(2) // in here we block ALL CONNECTIONS on this thread
  next()
}
```

Never call blocking functions or do blocking I/O of any sorts.
The active thread is shared between many connections (Channels),
which will all block.

> The attentive reader may notice that the `Router` itself acts like a
> middleware (its `handle` method matches the `Middleware` signature).
> This is how you can chain together Routers w/ little effort
> (add Routers to other Routers).


### Step 3.3: Hook up the Router to the App

#### Let the App itself be a Router

This one is easy. In Express the application object itself is also a Router,
that is, you can call `app.use { ... }` on it.
The only thing we have to do here, is make `Router` a superclass of our
existing `Express` app object.

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L7)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - adjust

open class Express : Router { // <= make Router the superclass
  ...
}
```

#### Hook up the Router to the HTTP Handler

Now that we have the Router, we can hook it up to the HTTP handler and let it
drive the incoming requests.
Let's go back to the HTTPHandler class.
We are going to change it so, that we:
1. pass in the router in init (`HTTPHandler(router: self)`)
2. store it in a property
3. invoke it with our request/response objects

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L49)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - adjust HTTPHandler

  final class HTTPHandler : ChannelInboundHandler {
    typealias InboundIn = HTTPServerRequestPart
    
    let router : Router
    
    init(router: Router) {
      self.router = router
    }
    
    func channelRead(ctx: ChannelHandlerContext, data: NIOAny) {
      let reqPart = unwrapInboundIn(data)
      
      switch reqPart {
        case .head(let header):
          let request  = IncomingMessage(header: header)
          let response = ServerResponse(channel: ctx.channel)
          
          // trigger Router
          router.handle(request: request, response: response) {
            (items : Any...) in // the final handler
            response.status = .notFound
            response.send("No middleware handled the request!")
          }

        // ignore incoming content to keep it micro :-)
        case .body, .end: break
      }
    }
  }
```

Notice how we pass in a `next` function when we call 
`handle`.
This `next` function is called when no middleware handled
the request, i.e. no middleware did **not** call `next`.
This is also known as the `final` handler.
We emit a 404 response.

There is one more change:
We need to pass in the router to the handler when we create it as part of the
Bootstrap.
And since the `Express` app object is a router itself now,
we just pass in `self`:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Express.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Express.swift#L23)
```swift
// File: Express.swift - adjust

  .childChannelInitializer { channel in
    channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline().then {
      channel.pipeline.add(
        handler: HTTPHandler(router: self))
    }
  }
```

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
You can find this setup in the
[nio-tutorial/3-middleware](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/tree/nio-tutorial/3-middleware)
branch.


### Finally! MicroExpress "Hello World"

Now we have everything in place to do an actual hello world,
using "middleware" and all that.
Open the `main.swift` file, which currently just has the server setup:

```swift
let app = Express()

app.listen(1337)
```

Let's add some routes to that!

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[main.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/main.swift)
```swift
// File: main.swift - update existing file

let app = Express()

// Logging
app.use { req, res, next in
  print("\(req.header.method):", req.header.uri)
  next() // continue processing
}

// Request Handling
app.use { _, res, _ in
  res.send("Hello, Schwifty world!")
}

app.listen(1337)
```

Compile it, run it, access it using:
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337)

Note how the logging middleware logs our request using Swift `print`,
and then the execution continues with the actual handler middleware.


### Step 3.4: Have: `use()`. Want: `get(path)`!

Above we use `use()` to register our middleware.
This is not what we usually do in Express,
we usually use `get()`, `post()`, `delete()` etc. w/ a path 
to register middleware,
for example:

```swift
app.get("/moo") { req, res, next in
  res.send("Muhhh")
}
```

This is only triggered if the HTTP method is `GET` and the URL path
starts with `/moo`.
Suprisingly trivial to add to `Router.swift`:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[Router.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/3-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/Router.swift#L37)
```swift
// File: Router.swift - add this to Router.swift
public extension Router {
  
  /// Register a middleware which triggers on a `GET`
  /// with a specific path prefix.
  public func get(_ path: String = "", 
                  middleware: @escaping Middleware)
  {
    use { req, res, next in
      guard req.header.method == .GET,
            req.header.uri.hasPrefix(path)
       else { return next() }
      
      middleware(req, res, next)
    }
  }
}
```

The trick here is that we embed the middleware within another middleware.
The enclosing middleware only runs the embedded one 
when the HTTP method and path matches,
otherwise it just passes on using `next`.

Using this we can now actually "route", for example:

```swift
app.get("/hello") { _, res, _ in 
  res.send("Hello")
}
app.get("/moo")   { _, res, _ in 
  res.send("Moo!") 
}
```


## Step 4: Reusable Middleware

Middleware functions can do anything you like,
but quite often **reusable middleware** - which is what we long for -
extracts data from the request and passes on a parsed form to the actual
"handler" middleware.
It could be some form of Auth, or JSON body parsing, or:<br>
One thing you often want to do: parse query parameters.
Let's do a reusable middleware for that!

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[QueryString.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/4-reusable-middleware/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/QueryString.swift)
```swift
// File: QueryString.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

import Foundation

fileprivate let paramDictKey = 
                  "de.zeezide.Âµe.param"

/// A middleware which parses the URL query
/// parameters. You can then access them
/// using:
///
///     req.param("id")
///
public 
func querystring(req  : IncomingMessage,
                 res  : ServerResponse,
                 next : @escaping Next)
{
  // use Foundation to parse the `?a=x` 
  // parameters
  if let queryItems = URLComponents(string: req.header.uri)?.queryItems {
    req.userInfo[paramDictKey] =
      Dictionary(grouping: queryItems, by: { $0.name })
        .mapValues { $0.flatMap({ $0.value })
	               .joined(separator: ",") }
  }
  
  // pass on control to next middleware
  next()
}

public extension IncomingMessage {
  
  /// Access query parameters, like:
  ///     
  ///     let userID = req.param("id")
  ///     let token  = req.param("token")
  ///
  func param(_ id: String) -> String? {
    return (userInfo[paramDictKey] 
       as? [ String : String ])?[id]
  }
}
```

We use the `IncomingMessage.userInfo` property to persist the parsed query
parameters and pass it over to subsequent middleware.

Want to try it? You could modify the `main.swift` like this:

```swift
app.use(querystring) // parse query params

app.get { req, res, _ in
  let text = req.param("text")
          ?? "Schwifty"
  res.send("Hello, \(text) world!")
}
```

Then call it like this:
[http://localhost:1337/?text=Awesome](http://localhost:1337/?text=Awesome).


## Step 5: JSON API using Codable

So far we just sent plain texts to the browser.
Lets enhance our microframework to support a JSON API,
and implement the read part of the famous
[Todo-Backend](http://todobackend.com) API:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/microexpress/07-microexpress-todomvc.png" 
  /></center>
  
Before we begin, we add a more convenient way to set HTTP headers in the
response (feel free to adjust this for `IncomingMessage`, hint: use a protocol).

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[ServerResponse.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/ServerResponse.swift#L58)
```swift
// File: ServerResponse.swift - add this to the end

public extension ServerResponse {
    
  /// A more convenient header accessor. Not correct for
  /// any header.
  public subscript(name: String) -> String? {
    set {
      assert(!didWriteHeader, "header is out!")
      if let v = newValue {
        headers.replaceOrAdd(name: name, value: v)
      }
      else {
        headers.remove(name: name)
      }
    }
    get {
      return headers[name].joined(separator: ", ")
    }
  }
}
```

> Note:
> This subscript does not work for all HTTP headers, but for a lot of simple
> ones it does.


First thing we need is a model containing the data we want to deliver to the
API client.
In this case a list of todos (the real API has more fields, but it is enough
to get going):

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[TodoModel.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/TodoBackend/TodoModel.swift)
```swift
// File: TodoModel.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

struct Todo : Codable {
  var id        : Int
  var title     : String
  var completed : Bool
}

// Our fancy todo "database". Since it is
// immutable it is webscale and lock free, 
// if not useless.
let todos = [
  Todo(id: 42,   title: "Buy beer",
       completed: false),
  Todo(id: 1337, title: "Buy more beer",
       completed: false),
  Todo(id: 88,   title: "Drink beer",
       completed: true)
]
```

Note that we are using the Swift 4
[Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types)
feature.
To deliver the JSON to the client, we enhance our `ServerResponse` object
with a `json()` function (similar to what Express does).
It can deliver any `Codable` object as JSON:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[ServerResponse.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/ServerResponse.swift#L80)
```swift
// File: ServerResponse.swift - add this to ServerResponse.swift

import Foundation

public extension ServerResponse {
  
  /// Send a Codable object as JSON to the client.
  func json<T: Encodable>(_ model: T) {
    // create a Data struct from the Codable object
    let data : Data
    do {
      data = try JSONEncoder().encode(model)
    }
    catch {
      return handleError(error)
    }
    
    // setup JSON headers
    self["Content-Type"]   = "application/json"
    self["Content-Length"] = "\(data.count)"
    
    // send the headers and the data
    flushHeader()
    
    var buffer = channel.allocator.buffer(capacity: data.count)
    buffer.write(bytes: data)
    let part = HTTPServerResponsePart.body(.byteBuffer(buffer))

    _ = channel.writeAndFlush(part)
               .mapIfError(handleError)
               .map { self.end() }
  }
}
```

Finally, lets create a middleware which sends our todos to the client:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[main.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/TodoBackend/main.swift#L14)
```swift
// File: main.swift - add this to main.swift

app.get("/todomvc") { _, res, _ in
  // send JSON to the browser
  res.json(todos)
}
```

To check whether it works, rebuild and rerun the project.
Then open [http://localhost:1337/todomvc/](http://localhost:1337/todomvc/)
in the browser. You should see the proper JSON:
```json
[ { "id": 42,   "title": "Buy beer", 
    "completed": false },
  { "id": 1337, "title": "Buy more beer",
    "completed": false },
  { "id": 88,   "title": "Drink beer",
    "completed": true  } ]
```

Lets try our API with the actual TodoBackend client:<br>
[http://todobackend.com/client/index.html?http://localhost:1337/todomvc/](http://todobackend.com/client/index.html?http://localhost:1337/todomvc/)

If we do this, the todo list in the client shows up empty! ðŸ¤”
If you open the JavaScript console in the browser debugger, you'll see an
error like this:
```
Origin http://todobackend.com \
  is not allowed by \
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin. \
  http://localhost:1337/todomvc/
```
We did nothing less but run a cross-site scripting attack on ourselves!
Because our API and todobackend.com are different hosts,
the browser denies access to our API.


### CORS

To make this work we need to implement
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
aka CORS.
Lets quickly make a reusable middleware function which sets up the proper
CORS headers, it is just a few lines of code:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[CORS.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/MicroExpress/CORS.swift)
```swift
// File: CORS.swift - create this in Sources/MicroExpress

public func cors(allowOrigin origin: String) 
            -> Middleware
{
  return { req, res, next in
    res["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"]  = origin
    res["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] = "Accept, Content-Type"
    res["Access-Control-Allow-Methods"] = "GET, OPTIONS"
    
    // we handle the options
    if req.header.method == .OPTIONS {
      res["Allow"] = "GET, OPTIONS"
      res.send("")
    }
    else { // we set the proper headers
      next()
    }
  }
}
```

To use it, add the `cors` middleware above your TodoMVC middleware in
`main.swift`,
e.g. like this:

<img src="/images/gh.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.1em; text-align: bottom;"/>
[main.swift](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress/blob/nio-tutorial/5-json/MicroExpress/Sources/TodoBackend/main.swift#L4)
```swift
// File: main.swift - change this in main.swift

app.use(querystring, 
        cors(allowOrigin: "*"))
```

> Note: For `cors()` we use a common pattern done in JavaScript,
>       `cors()` itself is not a middleware function, but it
>       **returns** one (as a closure).

Rerun the server, and the TodoBackend client should now show our beautiful
todos:<br>
[http://todobackend.com/client/index.html?http://localhost:1337/todomvc/](http://todobackend.com/client/index.html?http://localhost:1337/todomvc/)


## Summary

That's it for now.
On top of Swift NIO
we built an asynchronous micro-framework featuring
middleware, routing, JSON and CORS support
in about **350 lines of code**.
Sure, it is not everything you may need yet, but it is a pretty decent way
to write Swift HTTP and JSON endpoints.

I hope we have shown that you may not need some hipster "framework"
and can accomplish a lot w/ very little code and dependencies.
In about an hour you can spin your own.
Choose independent reusable modules with as little dependencies as possible.

What's next? Add support for Mustache templates using our
"[ÂµExpress/NIO - Adding Templates](/microexpress-nio-templates/)"
tutorial.

### Enhancements

Stuff which breaks the scope of the post but which you can add easily:

- POST processing (consuming) input, ~50 LOC
- Template handling. Make use of the Swift NIO FileIOHelper,
  and you favorite templating library.
  New: "[ÂµExpress/NIO - Adding Templates](/microexpress-nio-templates/)"
  tutorial!
- Add support for error middleware: ~50 LOC
- Matching pathes w/ inline arguments (`/users/:id`), ~100 LOC
- Database access using your favorite library,
  here you need to make sure you got one which supports async queries!
