The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) 
coming with Swift 5.5 now supports the
[`@main`](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/what-does-main-do-in-swift-5.3/)
attribute.
We can use that to build apps using just 
[VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and SwiftPM, 
no Xcode involved!
Let's use it to build a
[Cowtastic](https://zeezide.de/en/products/codecows/index.html) app!

The
[`@main`](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/what-does-main-do-in-swift-5.3/)
attribute was actually introduced in earlier, but starting w/ Swift 5.5
it is now also supported in Swift Package Manager.
([ObjC.io](https://www.objc.io) also has a nice pre-`@main`
 [article](https://www.objc.io/blog/2020/05/19/swiftui-without-an-xcodeproj/)
 about this, requiring more boilerplate.)

This is what is possible now, w/o having to use Xcode:
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup { 
      Text("Hello World!").padding()
    }
  }
}
```
Produces this little thing when it is run:
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/hello-world.png" /></center>


## Installing VisualStudio Code w/ Swift

This is really easy, download VisualStudio Code from Microsofts
[Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download),
and drag it to the ``/Applications`` folder.

One may also want to link up the `code` tool, so that VSC can be started
from the shell:
```
$ ln -s "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code" \
        /usr/local/bin/code
```

On startup, VSCode is going to show a little tutorial, though most things
are self explanatory. The basics:

- They call the dock on the left the "activity bar". It is roughly comparable
  to the sidebar tab selector in Xcode. Relevant shortcuts:
  - `‚åò‚áß E`:    Jump into the "Explorer" (the file navigation pane)
                    **and** if the focus is on the Explorer, back to the editor 
                    (thanks [@pfriedrich_](https://twitter.com/pfriedrich_)).
  - `‚åò‚áß F`:    Open search pane.
  - `‚åò‚áß D`:    Run & Debug pane (also seems to be used for tests).
  - `^‚áß G`: Git pane.
- A terminal can be brought up using `Ctrl-Backtick` (similar to `M-x shell`)
- More shortcuts:
  - Navigate forward/backward: `‚åò‚å• <` / `‚åò‚å• >`
  - `F5`: Start in debugger, `^ F5`: just run
  - `F12`: Jump to definition of a symbol
  - `‚åò‚áß N`: Open a new VSCode window
  - `‚åò‚áß P`: Open "command palette", this is similar to `M-x` in Emacs,
            one can invoke all the available functions.
- Usually you seem to open just one "folder" in a VSCode window (similar to
  Xcode),
  which is your project root (though you can also create workspaces, 
  again similar to Xcode).

Afterwards one can install the "Swift Language Support for Visual Studio Code"
extension using the extensions button in the activity bar. Search for
"Swift", should be the top hit:
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/vscode-install-swift-annotated.png" /></center>

So far so gut, the ARI ran into no issues.

## Setting up the SwiftPM Boilerplate

The new [Swift extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang) 
for VisualStudio Code doesn't yet support creating new Swift projects.
So that part still has to be done in the shell.

First make sure that Swift 5.5 is active:
```bash
$ swift --version
swift-driver version: 1.26.21 Apple Swift version 5.5.2 (swiftlang-1300.0.47.5 clang-1300.0.29.30)
Target: arm64-apple-macosx11.0
```

If it is not: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`.

Next create the package boilerplate:
```bash
$ mkdir Tows && cd Tows
$ swift package init --type executable
Creating executable package: Tows
Creating Package.swift
Creating README.md
Creating .gitignore
Creating Sources/
Creating Sources/Tows/main.swift
Creating Tests/
Creating Tests/TowsTests/
Creating Tests/TowsTests/TowsTests.swift
```

This needs to be massaged a little more.
First we need to **rename** the **`main.swift`** to something else. 
`main.swift` is a special file which essentially wraps the whole content in
a big function (i.e. you can run statements like `print("Moo!")` at the top
level). This clashes with how `@main` works.

```bash
$ mv Sources/Tows/main.swift \
     Sources/Tows/Tows.swift
```

This can be opened in VisualStudio Code now, to do so, just type:
```bash
$ code .
```
It should come up like this:
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/02-open-empty-tows.png" /></center>

Replace the contents (the `print("Hello")`) with our
app as shown above:
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup { 
      Text("Hello World!").padding()
    }
  }
}
```

VSCode is going to show a set of errors:
<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/03-tows-app-only-11.png" /></center>

Oops. That says at least macOS *BS* is required. Easily fixed by adding that
requirement to our `Package.swift` file:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Tows",
  platforms: [ .macOS(.v11) ], // <= add this!
  dependencies: [],
  targets: [ .executableTarget(name: "Tows", dependencies: []) ]
)
```

And ... errors still show.
Looks like the Swift extension still has a bug w/ refreshing things when the 
platform changes.
This can be worked around by renaming the `Tows.swift` file to `Tows2.swift`
(just click on the filename in the explorer),
and et voil√†, the source looks proper now:

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/04-tows2-fix.png" /></center>

Excellent, let's start our app in the debugger by pressing `F5`,
it just works. Magic:

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/05-tows-debug-f5.png" /></center>

Notice the little "Hello World" window, that's the app:

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/hello-world.png" /></center>

You may have to search for the window, it is not put in front of your
other windows.

**IMPORTANT**: This is not quite a full app yet. 
You'll notice it has no menu bar and if you quit it, you'll quit your editor
instead üòà
To close it, you need stop it in the VSCode debugger.


## Fixing the App Activation

To make the thing behave like an app proper,
a Cocoa with Love 
[trick](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/09/minimalist-cocoa-programming.html)
from 2010 has to be applied.
We are going to add an `init` to our `App` structure:
```swift
@main
struct HelloWorld: App {
  
  init() {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
      NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
      NSApp.windows.first?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }    
  }
  ...
}
```

Re-run the tool by pressing `F5` again, it'll have a menu proper and it can be quit as usual.

We are done. That is all which is required. But can we write more complex apps
with that? Something [cowtastic](https://zeezide.de/en/products/codecows/)?
Yes we can!

CompuCow Discovers Bug in Compiler

## üêÆ A Cowtastic App üêÆ

This thing, as a SwiftPM tool, in 82 lines of code 
(including support for search, selection and dragging):

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/compucow.png" /></center>

We are going to use the Swift
[cows](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows)
package, let's add it as a dependency to `Package.swift`
(remember to add both, the package **and** the target dependency):
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Tows",
  platforms: [ .macOS(.v11) ],
  dependencies: [ // add this:
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows",
             from: "1.0.10")
  ],
  targets: [ 
    .executableTarget(name: "Tows", 
                      dependencies: [ "cows" ]) // <= add this!
  ]
)
```

After doing this, a new "Package Dependencies" section will pop up in the
sidebar:

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tows/06-add-cows-package.png" /></center>


Let's update the application code.
Gist: [Tows.swift](https://gist.github.com/helje5/df0e7306229d5b6439972d9a43b70321)
```swift
import SwiftUI
import cows // @AlwaysRightInstitute

struct ContentView: View {
  
  @State var searchString  = ""
  @State var matches       = allCows
  @State var selectedCow   : String?
  
  let font = Font(NSFont
    .monospacedSystemFont(ofSize: NSFont.systemFontSize, weight: .regular))
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      ScrollView {
        TextField("Search", text: $searchString)
          .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
          .padding(8)
          .onChange(of: searchString) { nv in
            matches = nv.isEmpty 
                    ? cows.allCows 
                    : cows.allCows.filter { $0.contains(searchString) }
          }
        Spacer()
      }
      
      ScrollView {
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
          if matches.isEmpty {
            Text("Didn't find cows matching '\(searchString)' üêÆ")
              .padding()
              .font(.title)
            Divider()
          }
          
          ForEach(matches.isEmpty ? allCows : matches, id: \.self) { cow in
            Text(verbatim: cow)
              .font(font)
              .onDrag { NSItemProvider(object: cow as NSString ) }
              .padding()
              .background(
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
                  .strokeBorder()
                  .foregroundColor(.accentColor)
                  .padding(4)
                  .opacity(selectedCow == cow ? 1 : 0)
              )
              .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
              .contentShape(Rectangle())
              .onTapGesture {
                selectedCow = selectedCow == cow ? nil : cow
              }
          }
        }
      }
      .ignoresSafeArea()
    }
  }
}

@main
struct Tows: App {
  
  init() {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
      NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
      NSApp.windows.first?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }
  }
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .frame(minWidth: 640, minHeight: 320)
    }
    .windowStyle(HiddenTitleBarWindowStyle())
  }
}
```

Just press `F5` and a Cowtastic app is being started:

## Closing Notes

Looks like a pretty nice
[Swift for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang)
extension.
It still has some limitations, but
[Adam Fowler](https://twitter.com/o_aberration)
and
[Steven Van Impe](https://twitter.com/pwsacademy)
did a great job.

Want to have a readymade app that is properly reviewed by 
Apple's AppStore team?

     align="right" width="86" height="86" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" /></a>
There is [CodeCows](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecows/id1176112058).
Which (amongst other things) features a (language aware) Xcode extension (yes!)
and support for macOS services
(i.e. automatic ASCII Cows support in any Cocoa text field).

And for iOS there is 
[ASCII Cows](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/ascii-cows/id1176152684).
Includes a Messages app and proper Markdown support, so that you can paste
the cows into WhatsApp properly.
