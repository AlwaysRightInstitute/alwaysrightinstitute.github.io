The Always Right Institute has been established to encourage a culture of being
right. As well as being right. Always. Definitely sometimes.

It started out with being right about the `EMAIL` attribute on the
[RFC 5545 ATTENDEE property](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.4.1)
(see, it does not have an X- prefix, hence it must be standard!).
Now the ARI claims to be almost always sometimes definitely be right. Word!
