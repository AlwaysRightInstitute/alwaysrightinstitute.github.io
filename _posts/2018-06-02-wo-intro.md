Only a few more months before the introduction of WebObjects 6 at WWDC 2019,
let's have a look on what 
[WebObjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebObjects)
actually is.
And more specifically how it could look like in Swift. 
A small tutorial,
and an implementation of the 
WebObjects API in Swift, or as we like to call it:
[SwiftObjects](http://swiftobjects.org).

Let's jump back, 3 years, May 4th 2016:
[Apple officially killed one of Steve Job's favorite projects](https://www.businessinsider.de/apple-officially-discontinues-webobjects-2016-5?r=US&IR=T):
> "WebObjects is a discontinued product and will never be upgraded."

So while WebObjects 5 (the Java version) can still be downloaded from 
Apple Downloads,
it is discontinued by Apple for more than 10 years now (last version was
5.4.3, from 2008).
Yet a surprising amount of web sites are still using it. 
Most prominently the dreaded iTunes Connect:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/iTunesConnectAddressBarAnno.jpg" 
  /></center>

You can usually tell something is backed by WebObjects by looking at the URL:

    /WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app
     |          |                 |  |- custom path
     |          |                 \- WORequestHandler key (ra 🤔)
     |          \- Application Name
     \- Adapter Prefix
     
This literally says "WebObjects", but the application is also named ".woa"
(Web Objects Application).

Today we are going to resurrect it and have a look what made it great,
and why that isn't much relevant anymore.
But before we start, we need to setup a development environment.


## Raw Project Setup with Xcode 12

Since SwiftXcode is kinda outdated, this section deals with getting
SwiftObjects running w/ the builtin SPM support in Xcode.
It isn't as convenient, because SwiftXcode also includes Xcode project
templates for WO applications.

The setup instructions for Xcode 10 / SwiftXcode can still be found below.

### Create Xcode Tool Project

First create a "macOS / Command Line Tool" project in Xcode.
Select "Swift" as the language and choose a nice project name,
like "HelloWOrld".

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/01-so-create-tool-project-1.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/01-so-create-tool-project-1-cut.png" 
  /></a></center>

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/02-so-create-tool-project-2.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/02-so-create-tool-project-2.png" 
  /></a></center>

The result is an almost empty project with just a "main.swift" file.
The next step is to add "SwiftObjects" as a dependency.
To do this, select the "HelloWOrld" project (not the target).
And within that the "Swift Packages" tab. Press the "+" button to
add a dependency.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/11-tool-project-deps-1.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/11-tool-project-deps-1-cut.png" 
  /></a></center>


In the wizard that is shown, enter
"https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects.git"
as the package URL.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/12-tool-project-deps-add-2.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/12-tool-project-deps-add-2.png" 
  /></a></center>

The subsequent panel allows the selection of a version,
leave it the way it is and press "Next":

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/13-tool-project-deps-add-version.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/13-tool-project-deps-add-version.png" 
  /></a></center>

Xcode is going to resolve the package and offer to add it to the "HelloWOrld"
target. Approve this.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/15-tool-project-deps-add-to-target.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/15-tool-project-deps-add-to-target.png" 
  /></a></center>


The tool project now has the SwiftObjects dependency. To try it out,
we can switch to the "main.swift" file and add `import SwiftObjects`,
then "build" the project in Xcode.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/17-tool-import-SwiftObjects-prebuild.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/17-tool-import-SwiftObjects-prebuild-cut.png" 
  /></a></center>

> You'll notice that SwiftObjects is hooked up to the excellent
> [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio),
> but that doesn't really matter here.
> The API can also be driven by something like 
> [mod_swift](http://mod-swift.org), Network.framework or whatever you prefer.

### Adding the App Boilerplate

> This is a step which used to be automated using
> [SwiftXcode](https://swiftxcode.github.io),
> which provides Xcode project and file templates to setup the boilerplate.
> In Xcode 12 we have to do it manually for now.
> It isn't much though.

The article will go into details later, but a basic app usually starts out
with a custom `Application` class and a `Main` component.

The `Application.swift` should look like this:
```swift
import SwiftObjects

class Application: WOApplication {
  
  override init() {
    super.init()
    
    let rm = WODevResourceManager(
      sourceType       : Application.self,
      defaultFramework : "HelloWOrld"
    )
    
    rm.register(Main.self)
    resourceManager = rm
  }
}
```

Put the `Main.swift` and the `Main.html` into a "Components" subfolder.
The component can stay empty for now:
```swift
import SwiftObjects

class Main: WOComponent {
}
```

But put something into the `Main.html`, can be arbitrary HTML code, or
just some plain text:
```
Hello World
```

Finally we need to start the app from within the tool's `main.swift`:
```swift
import SwiftObjects

let WOApp  = Application()
let server = WONIOAdaptor(application: WOApp)
server.listenAndWait()
```

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/22-boilerplate-main-html.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/xcode12/22-boilerplate-main-html-cut.png" 
  /></a></center>


This should be enough to start the basic app and get "Hello World!"
when hitting it at `http://localhost:1337` in the browser.


## Project Setup with SwiftXcode (old)

> Update 2019-06-25: Xcode 11 now includes some Swift Package Manager support.
> This may or may not work with the SwiftXcode setup described here. So for
> now consider this Xcode 10 only ;-)

<a href="https://swiftxcode.github.io" target="extlink"><img src="http://zeezide.com/img/SwiftXcodePkgIcon.svg"
     align="right" width="86" height="86" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" /></a>
Instead of fiddling around with Swift Package Manager,
we use 
[swift xcode](https://swiftxcode.github.io)
to use SwiftObjects directly within Xcode.
Grab [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it yet, and install the 
[SwiftObjects image](https://github.com/SwiftXcode/SwiftObjects_XcodeImage)
using:
```shell
brew install swiftxcode/swiftxcode/swift-xcode-wo
swift xcode link-templates
```

That will take a moment to install and compile, but then we are ready to go!

> You'll notice that SwiftObjects is hooked up to the excellent
> [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio),
> but that doesn't really matter here.
> The API can also be driven by something like 
> [mod_swift](http://mod-swift.org), Kitura or whatever you prefer.


### Create and Run First Project

Within Xcode, create a new project (⌘-Shift-N),
go to the "macOS" section and select the "WOApplication"
template, very much at the bottom of the inspector
(pro tip: type "wo" in the filter field at the upper right):

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/01-so-create-project-1.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/01-so-create-project-1.png" 
  /></a></center>

Give your project a name, say "HelloWOrld" create it somewhere, and you should
end up with something like this:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/05-so-create-project-5.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/05-so-create-project-5.png" 
  /></a></center>
  
Press the Play/Run button to build and start the application. Open your
favorite browser and navigate to
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/):

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/21-main-page.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/21-main-page.png" 
  /></a></center>

Yay. History is up and running!

> As you see we got some default content in our HTML page.
> That it looks a little nice is because we embed the
> [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)
> CSS framework. Doesn't really matter here, you can use anything you like.

Try something: In the form at the bottom change "Homepage" to "Hello World"
and press the "Submit Query button". The title of the page will update:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/23-page-title-updated.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/23-page-title-updated-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>

Also notice the URL in the browser, it now contains a URL generated by
SwiftObjects. A so called "component action URL".
It follows the pattern we mentioned above:
application name (just "Application"),
request handler key ("wo" for "component action"),
and extra stuff (in here, a session-id, a context-id and an element-id).


## Basic Concepts

Before we continue, a small introduction on terminology and a high level
overview.

WebObjects contains many cool ideas and concepts, but the key idea
is to free the web application developer from having to think about low level 
HTTP things like "URLs", "form parameters" or session management.

<center><em>It brings Model View Controller (MVC) and Target/Action to the web.</em></center>

### Target / Action

Consider this *controller* object, called a
[WOComponent](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOComponent.swift#L11)
in WebObjects:

```swift
class Main : WOComponent {
    var counter = 0
    
    func incrementCounter() -> Any? {
        counter += 1
        return nil // stay on page
    }
}
```

and this accompanying template:

```html
  <wo:a action="incrementCounter">++</wo:a>
```

It may display like this:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/32-increment-link.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/32-increment-link-zoom.png" 
  style="border: 1px solid #AAA; padding-right: 10px;"/></a></center>

If you press the small `++` link, WebObjects will take care of everything and
call your `incrementCounter`
method, which increments the counter, and re-renders the page.

The
[WOHyperlink](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOHyperlink.swift#L52)
backing `<wo:a>` sends the component (the *target*) an
*action* (`incrementCounter`)
when the user clicks the link.
The `WOHyperlink` automatically generates a unique URL which represents the 
action and preserves the state required to resurrect the component object for a 
click.

> Again: URL generation is automatic in WebObjects, the programmer does not
>        have to concern himself about URLs, URL matching or anything like
>        that!
>        He wires up buttons to controllers using actions. Just like in UIKit!
> <br/>
> Just like you don't usually deal with a
> [UIEvent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uievent)
> in UIKit, you don't usually have to deal with a WORequest in WO.


### Model View Controller (MVC)

WebObjects generally follows the MVC paradigm.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/MVC.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/MVC.png" 
  /></a></center>

#### Controller

The
[`WOComponent`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOComponent.swift#L11)
is the controller, similar to a 
[`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller?changes=_3).
It interacts with the view, the model and responds to user actions.
Components react to actions emitted by the controls in the view tree.
For example if the user clicks a link, a 
[`WOHyperlink`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOHyperlink.swift#L52)
will call an action method in the component.

Like in UIKit, a `WOComponent` can embed other components,
also known as controller containment.
This way you can build up a complex web page from different, 
reusable components.

#### View

The view part is the "template", a tree of
[`WODynamicElement`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WODynamicElement.swift#L33)
objects.
Unlike the "template engines" you probably know about,
**a WebObjects template does not only render HTML**.
**It also processes input**, like form values or reacts to link-clicks!

For example the
[`WOTextField`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Forms/WOTextField.swift#L64)
not only renders the `<input type="text" value="abc">` HTML tag.
When a form POST request is received, it also extracts the corresponding 
form value and pushes the value into the controller.
Like UIView's, they do both, the "rendering" and the "event handling".

#### Model

We don't look at the model in this blog entry.
In the original WebObjects you would usually use the
[Enterprise Objects Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Objects_Framework) (EOF).
Today's [CoreData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Data)
is essentially a reduced version of EOF.
In SwiftObjects you could use [ZeeQL](http://zeeql.io),
or any other framework you like.

### Similarities with UIKit

Let's have a look at the WebObjects classes by looking at their UIKit
counterparts.
If you know UIKit, you'll feel right at home in WebObjects.

A [**`WODynamicElement`**](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WODynamicElement.swift) 
is like `UIView`, they "draw" the output (e.g. HTML)
**and** they handle events.
That they handle events is very different to other HTML templating frameworks.
Common elements are
[`WOHyperlink`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOHyperlink.swift#L52)
(roughly a `UIButton`),
[`WOImage`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOImage.swift)
(like a `UIImageView`),
[`WOTextField`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Forms/WOTextField.swift)
(like a `UITextField`),
or
[`WOString`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift)
(like a `UILabel`).

[**`WOComponents`**](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOComponent.swift)
are like `UIViewControllers`.
Their "`view`" is a template, which is just a tree of `WODynamicElement`'s
(just like UIViews form a hierarchy/tree).
They are the "controller" part in the MVC design pattern, and as in UIKit, you'll have
Massive-View-Controller, if you don't separate your concerns.
For that, like `UIViewController`s (controller containment),
`WOComponent`s can also be nested. Which means you
can build parts of a page from different components.
Note that this is again different from a simple template "include", 
in that the whole tree is also used for event processing.

The counterpart to `UIEvent` is essentially a 
[**`WORequest`**](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WORequest.swift).
If the user clicks a link in the browser, the browser will emit an HTTP request.
This request is packaged in a `WORequest` on the WO server side.
That is usually tied to a 
[`WOContext`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOContext.swift),
which also carries the 
[`WOResponse`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOResponse.swift),
into which the `WODynamicElement`s are going to render their visual representation.

An application is represented as a 
[**`WOApplication`**](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOApplication.swift)
object, usually a singleton in the server.
It corresponds to the `UIApplication` object in iOS.
There is also a 
[`WOAdaptor`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOAdaptor.swift)
object, which handles the HTTP protocol
(for SwiftObjects 
 [we use SwiftNIO](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/NIO/WONIOAdaptor.swift#L12)
 to do that part).

Since a server doesn't handle just one user but trillions, there is one extra class you
don't have in UIKit: 
[**`WOSession`**](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOSession.swift),
which allows you to hold per-user information.
(Things which are "global" in UIKit like the current Locale, may needs to be done on a per
 session or context basis in WO).
 
 Summary:
 
 - `UIView`           ➜ `WODynamicElement`
 - `UIViewController` ➜ `WOComponent`
 - `UIEvent`          ➜ `WORequest`
 - `UIApplication`    ➜ `WOApplication`
 - ☁️                 ➜ `WOSession`
 - `UIGestureRecognizer` ➜ 🤦‍♀️

> Note(2020-12-27): Apple released SwiftUI in 2019.
> The concepts of SwiftUI are stunningly similar to WebObjects.
> `WOAssociation`s are essentially the same like `Binding`s,
> `WODynamicElement`s are similar to `View`s w/o state,
> `WOComponent`s are `View`s w/ state (or `StateObject`'s).


## The setup of our example application

Now that we know the basic classes, let go back to our example and see what
the `WOApplication` template generated for us:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/06-so-create-project-6-zoom.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/06-so-create-project-6-zoom.png" 
  style="border: 1px solid #AAA; padding-right: 10px;"/></a></center>

The `Application` group contains
the global 
[`WOApplication`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOApplication.swift)
object, the thing required to start our HTTP server,
the Session and Context objects in case you want to customize them
(we won't).

Instead let's focus on the components. The default template contains two
components: `Main` and `Frame`. `Main` is rendered as the first page the
user sees when opening the application (like the initial view controller
in a storyboard). `Frame` is a reusable component which wraps around content of
the `Main` component.
Components are constructed from up to three files:

### Controller: The Component.swift file

This contains the Swift controller class, treat it like a UIViewController.
You can put properties and actions into that, which you can then bind to
the view layer. Example:

```swift
import SwiftObjects

class Main : WOComponent {
    
    var title : String = "Hello World!"
    
    override func awake() { // kinda like `viewDidLoad()`
        super.awake()
        expose(doubleTitle, as: "doubleTitle") // a Swift wart
    }
    
    func doubleTitle() -> WOComponent? {
        title = title + title
        return nil // stay on this page
    }
}
```

Note: A component is not required to have a Swift class. Like `Frame`
in the boilerplate, 
you can have just a template, but still access the dynamic elements from
within those!
If there is no custom Swift class, SwiftObjects will use the
[`WOComponent`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOComponent.swift)
class.


### View: The Component.html file

The Component.html file contains the template associated with the controller.
Remember that in WO the template is *not just for rendering*.
It corresponds to what you do in a XIB file. You lay out the user interface
and place dynamic elements into it.

```html
<h1><WEBOBJECT NAME="Title"></WEBOBJECT></h1>
<p>
  Some text
</p>
```

`<WEBOBJECT>` tags are used to inject dynamic elements into the otherwise
static HTML content.
In original WebObjects you would only use those, but SwiftObjects also allows
you to add elements using either: `<wo:Element bindings..>` or
`<#Element bindings ...>`.

> Historical sidenote: There used to be a visual design tool for WebObjects
> called "WebObjects Builder". Just like in IB, you could wire up the
> web controls with the WOComponents.

> and the
> [WWDC 2000 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHo7Z6Xc4I) on how to use
> it.

### Bindings: Component.wod

WOD stands for "WebObject Definitions". In the template we only said we want a
WebObject called "Title", we didn't specify what it is and how it is configured.
This can be done in the `.wod` file:

```
Title: WOString {
  value          = title;
  valueWhenEmpty = "placeholder";
}
```

This says that the "Title" element is a
[`WOString`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift#L51)
dynamic element (similar to a UILabel).
What follows is a set of "bindings". The left side is a parameter supported
by the `WOString`, here 
[`value`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift#L53)
and 
[`valueWhenEmpty`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift#L55).

The right side is a so called
[`WOAssociation`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Core/WOAssociation.swift),
usually either a
[`WOKeyPathAssociation`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Associations/WOKeyPathAssociation.swift#L12)
or a 
[`WOValueAssociation`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Associations/WOValueAssociation.swift#L21).

The `= title` syntax results in a `WOKeyPathAssociation`.
When the `WOString` renders its HTML to the response, it will retrieve the 
`title` property from the `WOComponent`, look above, this thing:

```swift
class Main : WOComponent {
    var title : String = "Hello World!" // ☜
    ...
}
```

That is, the `WOString` will render the text "Hello World".

The `= "placeholder"` is a *constant* string. It is taken as-is. In this case
it means that if the `title` is empty, the `WOString` will render "placeholder".

### Template Shortcuts

When typing templates without WebObjects Builder, having to type in three files
quickly becomes annoying.
Hence SwiftObjects supports a few shortcuts. The example above can be written
without a `.wod` file, directly in the template:

```html
<h1><#WOString value="$title" valueWhenEmpty="placeholder" /></h1>
```
Note how the `$` is used to denote a keypath association.

This is another shortcut which uses a "shortname" for an element:
```html
<h1><wo:str value="$title" valueWhenEmpty="placeholder" /></h1>
```
(other examples:
 `wo:if` for `WOConditional`, `wo:for` for `WORepetition`,
 `wo:radio` for `WORadioButton`, ...)


## Let's build an own app: WOx

We'll modify our application boilerplate a little. We want to use 
[Semantic UI Cards](https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html)
to show a list of nice cows like that:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/74-semui-card-nice.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/74-semui-card-nice.png" 
  /></a></center>

### Step A: A store containing nice cows

First create a new Swift file called `CowsStore.swift`. This contains our
dummy model.
A basic `Cow` class, and a `CowStore` to maintain them:

```swift
final class Cow {
    // Shouldn't that be a struct?! No, we are demoing 90s tech!
    var info    : String = ""
    var image   : String = ""
    var friends : Int    = 0
  
    init(info: String = "", image: String = "", friends: Int = 0) {
        self.info    = info
        self.image   = image
        self.friends = friends
    }
}

final class CowStore {
  
    let urlPrefix = "http://zeezide.com/img/SquareCows/"
    static let shared = CowStore()
  
    var cows : [ Cow ] = [
        Cow(info: "beef jerky",
            image: "carmen.jpg", friends: 0),
        Cow(info: "CompuCow Discovers Bug in Compiler",
            image: "sowmya.jpg", friends: 1337),
        Cow(info: "This cow jumped over the Moon",
            image: "gustl.jpg", friends: 42)
    ]
}
```

### Step B: Render the cows as a list on the Main page

Next open the `Main.swift`. On this page we want to show the list of our cows.
Change the title property to `WOx` and expose the `store` as a page property.
Also, add a property called `cow`. It should look like this:

```swift
final class Main : WOComponent {
  
    var title = "Homepage"
    let store = CowStore.shared
    var cow   : Cow? = nil
    ...
}
```

Then open the `Main.html` and drop everything but the `Frame` top-level tag.
Add this:

```html
<!-- Main.html -->
<WEBOBJECT NAME="Frame">
    <ul>
        <WEBOBJECT NAME="CowList">
            <li><WEBOBJECT NAME="CowInfo"></WEBOBJECT></li>
        </WEBOBJECT>
    </ul>
</WEBOBJECT>
```

Next we need to define the objects, so open the `Main.wod`, drop everything
but the `Frame` and add:

```
// Main.wod
Frame: Frame {
    title = title;
}

CowList: WORepetition {
    list = store.cows;
    item = cow;
}

CowInfo: WOString {
    value = cow.info;
}
```

If you restart the app and connect to
[http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/), you should now see
something like this:
<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/53-simple-cows-rep-run.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/53-simple-cows-rep-run-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>

In the "view" layer we created a
[`WORepetition`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WORepetition.swift),
which kinda acts like a UICollectionView:
it displays a bunch of items. Let's look at it:

```
CowList: WORepetition {
    list = store.cows;
    item = cow;
}
```

`list` and `item` are parameters the
[`WORepetition`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WORepetition.swift)
supports. We *bind* the keypath `store.cows` to the `list`.
`store` is the `CowsStore` property in our `Main` class.
And that `CowsStore` has a `cows` property we access
(an array of `Cow` objects).<br />
When the page is rendered, the repetition will loop over that array and
repeat its contents. While looping, the repetition will set the `item`
binding to the current item in the `list`.
Because we *bind* the `item = cow`, the repetition will *push* the current
value to the `cow` property in our `Main` class.

Now looking into what is contained in the repetition, we have a:
```
CowInfo: WOString {
    value = cow.info;
}
```
Remember, the repetition *pushed* the current cow into our `cow` property,
it contains the current cow from our cow array.
Now the 
[`WOString`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift)
`value` argument is bound to the `cow.info` keypath.
Which grabs the `info` property out of the `cow` and renders that on screen.

### Step C: A reusable Cow'mponent - CowCard.wo

Above we loop over the cows, and display a property of each using a
[`WOString`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift).
This is awesome already, but we actually want to display nice
[Semantic UI Cards](https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html)
with all the important cow info.

To do this, we are going to create a *reusable component*. Select the
`Components` group in Xcode, then invoke the new file panel (⌘-N).
In that panel, select the `WOComponent` template:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/61-new-component-wocomp.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/61-new-component-wocomp-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>

Call the file `CowCard` and make sure to place it in the `Components` folder,
you'll end up w/ something like this:


<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/64-new-component-html.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/64-new-component-html-zoom.png" 
  /></a></center>
  
Xcode creates a full component for you: The `CowCard.swift`, `CowCard.html` and
`CowCard.wod`. Open the `CowCard.html` and drop the whole content. Insert this
instead:

```html
<!-- CowCard.html -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="image">
    <img src="http://zeezide.com/img/SquareCows/<wo:str value="$cow.image" />">
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div class="header"><wo:str value="$cow.image" /></div>
    <wo:div class="meta">
      <a>Cool Cows</a>
    </wo:div>
    <wo:div class="description"><wo:str value="$cow.info" /></wo:div>
  </div>
  <div class="extra content">
    <span>
      <wo:str value="$cow.friends" /> Friends
    </span>
  </div>
</div>
```

This uses the shortcut syntax we explained before. It is the boilerplate
for [Semantic UI Cards](https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html),
with dynamic
[`WOString`](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOString.swift)
items that bind to a `cow` key.

Edit `Main.wod` and change it so, that it doesn't use a WOString anymore,
but our fresh `CowCard` component:

```
// Main.wod
CowInfo: CowCard {
    cow = cow;
}
```

This `cow = cow` looks funky. The left side `cow` is the parameter of the
`CowCard` component (the one we use in the template above).
We pass over the full, current, cow (to the WOString we just passed the 
`cow.info`).

Restart your app and it should look like:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/71-semui-card-render-li.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/71-semui-card-render-li.png" 
  /></a></center>

This looks a bit off, but notice that in our `Main` component we only changed
the `WOString` to our new `CowCard`, and tweaked the binding a little.
It shows how easily and quickly you can switch between components, and thereby
designs or different views on the same data.

It still looks a bit wrong, because in `Main.html` we put the cow cards into
a plain HTML list `<ul><li>`. Open `Main.html` and add the necessary Semantic UI
magic:
  
```html
<!-- Main.html -->
<WEBOBJECT NAME="Frame">
  <div class="ui link cards">
    <WEBOBJECT NAME="CowList">
      <WEBOBJECT NAME="CowInfo"></WEBOBJECT>
    </WEBOBJECT>
  </div>
</WEBOBJECT>
```
Gives:

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/74-semui-card-nice.png"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/74-semui-card-nice.png" 
  /></a></center>

Aren't those nice cow cards? You can't but admit that they are!  

We only scratched the surface, but could hopefully pass on a feeling on
how using "WebObjects" feels like.
The cow demo is also part of our small
[WOShowcase](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/tree/develop/Sources/WOShowcaseApp)
app, which comes w/ SwiftObjects.
That app also demos how to create new cows and how to edit cows,
*w/o having to deal with form parameters or any such* HTTP annoyances:

  /></a></center>

  /></a></center>


## Other WebObjects Frameworks

The WebObjects framework is just one part of the larger WebObjects "product".
WebObjects also came with other increbily powerful frameworks:

- [Enterprise Objects Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Objects_Framework) (EOF),
  an Object Relation Mapper (ORM).
  CoreData is essentially a reduced version of this. With EOF you could access
  arbitrary databases (say Oracle or [Frontbase](http://frontbase.com)).
  ([ZeeQL](http://zeeql.io) is our Swift take on this)
- Direct-To-Web (D2W). This is a rule evaluation system built around KVC.
  You can find a small intro over here
  [SOPE Rule System](http://sope.opengroupware.org/en/docs/snippets/rulesystem.html)
  and [here](https://wiki.wocommunity.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1049018).
  This seems to be a nice [video](https://www.wocommunity.org/podcasts/WOWODC09W-D2W-part1.mov)
  about it.
- Direct-To-JavaClient (D2JC). Like D2W, this would automagically build Java
  Swing client applications. Duh.
  ([Direct to SwiftUI](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/directtoswiftui/)
   is our Swift take on this)
- Direct-To-Web-Services. You know, when "WebServices" was the big hype ;-)



## Caveats

### Key value Coding

WebObjects relies heavily on 
[KVC (Key/Value Coding)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/index.html), 
which is not available in (pure) Swift, 
nor are the necessary reflection capabilities.
We provide workarounds, but such aren't great.

Not having this removes a lot of the beauty of WebObjects from SwiftObjects.
We very much hope that we are going to eventually have better reflection in
Swift 5.

### Web 2.0, AJAX and beyond

Most of the stuff shown is nice and useful for building Web 1 applications.
That is, applications which would render their UI as HTML, on the server side,
with little or no logic running in the browser.

This isn't universally true, but todays application servers are mostly API
endpoints for *Web 2.0 applications running in the browser*.
I.e. the server is mostly hosting the model, and none of the UI anymore.
While SwiftObjects has some features to support AJAX (e.g. page fragments via
[WOFragment](https://github.com/SwiftObjects/SwiftObjects/blob/develop/Sources/SwiftObjects/Elements/Basics/WOFragment.swift#L45)),
it is not how you usually build applications today.

Hence in **BIG LETTERS**:
This is a **demo** and an experiment to see whether and how the WebObjects API
might work in Swift.
Do **not** try this at home, it is not how you write web servers nowadays!

If you like what you've seen and you are looking for a modern client framework
allowing for similar component reuse, I can highly recommend
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). This is a lot like WebObjects on the client side
(nesting components, bindings, and all the nice stuff).<br />


## Usecase: OpenGroupware.org

(The now kinda extinct)
[OpenGroupware.org](http://www.opengroupware.org/)
is definitely the largest OpenSource application based on WebObjects technology
that exists. Maybe even the largest WO application ever.
If you know Basecamp (the RoR application), OGo is like a Web 1.0 
predecessor of that.
It does contact, project, meeting management, todo lists, and even
includes an IMAP4 email client.<br />

All with an old-school Web 1.0 interface, so take care of your eyes, this is
how it looked:

<a href="http://www.opengroupware.org/screens/webui/blue/index.html">
  <img src="http://www.opengroupware.org/screens/webui/blue/blue_mail.jpg" />
</a>

Yes, it is ugly by todays standards (and probably even back then).
Yet consider the complex UI with many tabs, sortable table views,
an outline tree view, and so on.
This was only possible because the UI was composed from many different
reusable components.
Feel free to browse the
[sources](http://svn.opengroupware.org/OpenGroupware.org/trunk/)
of OGo, it is a big application with loads of components.

Today OGo is very much outdated.
As a replacement with less functionality but much better scalability
and REST behaviour,
we wrote [ScalableOGo](http://www.scalableogo.org)
which combines WebObjects ideas with a lot of the features/ideas of
[Zope 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope#Zope_2).
While ScalableOGo is still being deployed today (the code was hi-jacked by a
Candian company), it is neither scalable nor modern anymore either 🤓
