[**PL/Swift**](https://pl-swift.github.io)
allows you to write custom SQL functions and types for the 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database server in the 
[Swift](http://swift.org/) programming language.<br/>
*Bringing Swift to the Backend of the Backend's Backend!*

Of course the ARI would love to help Chris with his modest goal! Today
most of the "Swift Server" efforts target "middleware" software and call that 
the "backend".
We thought we take Swift a step further, skip the database and make Swift
feed the database itself.
So indeed nothing less but:
Bringing Swift to the Backend of the Backend's Backend!

Assume you have a Swift function which turns an integer into a
[base36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36)
encoded String,
to replicate the trick used by URL shorteners
("`goo.gl/QvohfE`"):

```swift
func base36_encode(_ v: Int) -> String {
  return String(v, radix: 36)
}
```

and now you would like to use that in a SQL query, like so:

```sql
# SELECT base36_encode(31337);
 base36_encode 
---------------
 o6h
(1 row)
```

This is what PL/Swift does. It helps you expose your Swift functions to
PostgreSQL.

Let's have a look on how to do that!


## PL/Swift Installation

From here on we assume that you are on macOS,
that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) running,
and that you have PostgreSQL installed already
(e.g. [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com) is a nice way to do that on
 macOS, or just use Homebrew).
 (Note: all this also works just fine in Docker or in plain Linux,
  check the PL/Swift
  [install dox](https://pl-swift.github.io/docs/install/#install-using-docker)
  for the details).

You can simply install PL/Swift like so:

    brew tap PL-Swift/plswift
    brew install plswift

This installs Swift module maps, Xcode xconfig files, and a set of
[shell scripts](https://pl-swift.github.io/docs/tools/)
extending the Swift Package Manager.

All the shell scripts are invoked using `swift pl <subcommand>`,
for example to check whether your environment looks right, run:

```sh
$ swift pl validate
The Swift PostgreSQL build environment looks sound.

  srcroot:   /Users/helge
  module:    helge
  config:    debug
  product:   /Users/helge/.build/helge.so
  pg_config: /usr/local/bin/pg_config
  moddir:    /usr/local/lib/postgresql
  extdir:    /usr/local/share/postgresql/extension/
  PL/Swift:  /usr/local
  swift:     5.0.1
```

## Hello PL/Swift

Let's get started w/ a simple Hello World example. First we create a new Swift
module and initialize it as a PL/Swift one.
We use `swift pl init` to initialize the directory as a Swift module,
and to add the extras required for PostgreSQL:

```
$ mkdir helloswiftpl && cd helloswiftpl
$ swift pl init
The Swift PostgreSQL build environment looks sound.

  module:    helloswiftpl
  config:    debug
  product:   /Users/helge/tmp/helloswiftpl/.build/helloswiftpl.so
  pg_config: /usr/local/bin/pg_config
  PL/Swift:  /usr/local
```

The result is this directory hierarchy:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helloswiftpl
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helloswiftpl-ext.swift
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helloswiftpl.swift
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helloswiftpl--0.0.1.sql
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helloswiftpl.control
```

The `Package.swift` is the Swift Package Manager manifest.
It is a plain manifest and has a depedency to the
[PL/Swift](https://github.com/PL-Swift/PLSwift)
Swift module, which imports the necessary PostgreSQL headers and has some
API wrappers for PostgreSQL.

The `helloswiftpl.control` is the package manifest for PostgreSQL.
It just contains a short description, and the version of the package.
That version is used to refer to the `helloswiftpl--0.0.1.sql` which 
registers our functions to the PostgreSQL information schema:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION 
  helloswiftpl_hello() 
  RETURNS text
  AS '$libdir/helloswiftpl'
  LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE;
```

The `$libdir/helloswiftpl` is the name of the shared library which PostgreSQL
loads on demand.
`LANGUAGE C` says that we access the library using the platforms `C ABI`.
`IMMUTABLE` says that the function is stable, i.e. that it is save to cache
the results of the function (the opposite is `VOLATILE`, which we are going
to use later).

We'll skip the `helloswiftpl-ext.swift` for now. It contains the boilerplate
to register our Swift code w/ PostgreSQL.
Instead let's look at `helloswiftpl.swift` which just has a demo function:

```swift
func hello() -> String {
  return "Hello Schwifty World!"
}
```

To get this into PostgreSQL, let's build and install the extension:
```
$ swift pl install
Fetching https://github.com/PL-Swift/CPLSwift.git
Fetching https://github.com/PL-Swift/PLSwift.git

[2/2] Compiling Swift Module 'helloswiftpl' (2 sources)
```

then use `psql` to load the extension, and run our function:
```sql
$ psql
psql (10.1)
Type "help" for help.

# CREATE EXTENSION "helloswiftpl";
CREATE EXTENSION
# SELECT helloswiftpl_hello();
  helloswiftpl_hello   
-----------------------
 Hello Schwifty World!
(1 row)
```

Yay! PostgreSQL is running our
[Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E)
function.

> If your PostgreSQL Brew server is not running yet,
> you can start it using `brew services start postgresql`.
> (I usually use the nice [PostgreSQL.app](https://postgresapp.com) instead).


## Next Step: Cows, loads of üêÑüêÑüêÑ

This is all cool, but let's beef-it-up!
As with most languages, Swift's power comes from the packages available for it.
And one of the most important Swift packages apart from maybe leftpad is
[cows](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows).
Let's add that to the `Package.swift`, it should now look like this:
```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "helloswiftpl",
    
    products: [
      .library(name: "helloswiftpl", targets: [ "helloswiftpl" ]),
    ],
    
    dependencies: [
      .package(url: "https://github.com/PL-Swift/CPLSwift.git", from: "1.0.0"),
      .package(url: "https://github.com/PL-Swift/PLSwift.git",  from: "0.5.0"),
      .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git",
               from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    
    targets: [
      .target(name: "helloswiftpl", 
              dependencies: [ "CPLSwift", "PLSwift", "cows" ])
    ]    
)
```

And let's modify `helloswiftpl.swift` to use our cows:

```swift
import cows

func hello() -> String {
  return cows.vaca() // returns a random cow
}
```

There is one more thing we need to do. Above we declared the function in the
SQL as `IMMUTABLE`.
That is not true anymore, we return a new cow every time the function runs.
So let's modify the `helloswiftpl--0.0.1.sql` and replace `IMMUTABLE`
with `VOLATILE`:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION
  helloswiftpl_hello() RETURNS text
  AS '$libdir/helloswiftpl'
  LANGUAGE C VOLATILE STRICT;
```

Let's reinstall the extension:

```shell
$ swift pl build

Resolving https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git at 1.0.7
[2/2] Compiling Swift Module 'helloswiftpl' (2 sources)
$ swift pl install
```

And recreate and run it in `psql`:
```sql
$ psql
psql (10.1)
Type "help" for help.

# DROP EXTENSION "helloswiftpl";
DROP EXTENSION
# CREATE EXTENSION "helloswiftpl";
CREATE EXTENSION
# SELECT helloswiftpl_hello();
           helloswiftpl_hello            
-----------------------------------------
          (__)                          +
          (oo)     ____________________ +
   /-------\/     |                    |+
  / |     |\ /    |  o  o  o  o  o  o  |+
 *  ||----| /     ======================+
    ^^    ^       ||                  ||+
    Cowncillor            his cowch
(1 row)
```

Want 100 random cows?:

```sql
SELECT helloswiftpl_hello()
  FROM generate_series(1, 100);
```

## Handling Arguments

The above functions have been taking no arguments and are just
returning a `TEXT` (a `VARCHAR`).
We can tweek the function to return a specific cow by index:

```swift
func hello(_ idx: Int) -> String {
  return cows.allCows[idx % cows.allCows.count]
}
```

We need to tweak the SQL registration to carry the proper argument type,
an `integer`:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION 
  helloswiftpl_hello(integer)
  RETURNS text
  AS '$libdir/helloswiftpl'
  LANGUAGE C VOLATILE STRICT;
```

And this time we also need to touch the C/Swift mapping file 
 `helloswiftpl-ext.swift` to extract the argument and pass it over to our
 Swift function:

```swift
@_cdecl("helloswiftpl_hello")
public func hello(fcinfo: FunctionCallInfo) -> Datum {
  return hello(fcinfo.pointee[int: 0]).pgDatum
}
```

`FunctionCallInfo` is a pointer to a PostgreSQL struct representing the
arguments the function was called with.
We need to dereference that and then we can use a PL/Swift
helper subscript-function to extract an `Int` argument.

Build and install it:
```shell
$ swift pl build
$ swift pl install
```

And re-add the extension to PostgreSQL:
```sql
# DROP EXTENSION "helloswiftpl";
DROP EXTENSION
# CREATE EXTENSION "helloswiftpl";
CREATE EXTENSION
# \df  helloswiftpl_hello
                               List of functions
 Schema |        Name        | Result data type | Argument data types |  Type  
--------+--------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------
 public | helloswiftpl_hello | text             | integer             | normal
(1 row)

# SELECT helloswiftpl_hello(1337);
  helloswiftpl_hello  
----------------------
            (__)    ^+
            (oo)   / +
        _____\/___/  +
       /  /\ / /     +
      ^  /  * /      +
        / ___/       +
   *----/\           +
       /  \          +
      /   /          +
     ^    ^          +
 This cow does Disco
(1 row)
```

 
## Performance

So how fast is it? We used the base36 module from
[big elephants - Writing Postgres Extensions - the Basics](http://big-elephants.com/2015-10/writing-postgres-extensions-part-i/)
to do a small comparison.
This is what we run for a pure SQL version, the C version, and Swift debug and
release versions:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
  SELECT i, base36_encode(i) FROM generate_series(1,1e6::int) i;
```

- pure SQL: 31,987ms
- C: 600ms
- Swift debug: 3,238ms
- Swift release: 1,201ms

Note 2019-05-12: Outdated, this was against Swift 3.1. Swift 5 is probably
significantly faster.

## Summary

*Does this make sense?*
Very likely not, it depends, as usual.
But no. It doesn‚Äôt.
Consider this a neat demo, not something you should do in the real world.
