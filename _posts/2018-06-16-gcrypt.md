Given the recent events you may look down and acknowledge that you have been
wrong when hosting unencrypted data on 
[the Clown](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2018/06/lol-github/).
It looked so convenient and they wouldn't dare to touch your data and loose
all credibility. The rest is history.
Let's take the shame but move on: 
[git-remote-gcrypt](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt).


This is about moving off **private** GIT repositories off an unencrypted
Clown.
While we wouldn't even want to upload public repositories to some,
they are public after all, hence not concerned about people looking at
the public data.
This is different for private repos which contain works of beauty the painter
may or may not want the public to see just yet.

The common suggestion is to just host the GIT repository yourself. Which is
essentially a 5-minute setup if you have a server running already.
Or you can use something like [Gitea](https://gitea.io), which looks really
nice and I'm told it is also super-easy to setup.

Unfortunately I do not have a properly secured server running, and I suspect
it is actually not that easy for many to secure one either.
So I chose a different route. I still use a Clown, but I encrypt my data
before feeding it.
Again, one option on macOS is to use 
[encrypted disk images](http://technology.pitt.edu/help-desk/how-to-documents/creating-encrypted-disk-image-mac-os-x)
(which I sometimes do as well).
But disk images quickly corrupt if they live on Clown file storage and you
are not careful.

So I tried 
[git-remote-gcrypt](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt)
a few years ago, I was still using it, and it works pretty well.
It has some caveats you may want to consider
(read their [README](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt)).
Vary rarely the repo still corrupts, but if this happens, it is easy to just 
recreate the hosted repository from any clone.

## Installation

First you need to setup GPG, I use the
[GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org)
for that. Create a key if you have none, etc. It should be all very easy.

Next grab [`git-remote-gcrypt`](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt) 
and install it.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt.git
cd git-remote-gcrypt
./install.sh
```

You end up with a `git-remote-gcrypt` binary in `/usr/local/bin`.

## Migrating a Repository

Let's say you have a private GIT repository on some uncrypted clown. It may
look like this:

```shell
$ git status
On branch develop
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/develop'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:helje5/CoreS.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:helje5/CoreS.git (push)
```

We first need to create a new bare repository on the target filesystem,
for example:

```shell
$ git init --bare ~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/helge/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git/
```

Next we need to change the repositories `origin` from the old uncrypted clown
to the new encrypted location:
```shell
$ git remote set-url origin gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git
$ git remote -v
origin	gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git (fetch)
origin	gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git (push)
```
Notice the `gcrypt` URL scheme, this will make `git` use the `git-remote-gcrypt`
tool as the transport.

Finally, push your whole repo to the new, encrypted repository:
```shell
$ git push --all
gcrypt: Repository not found: ~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git
gcrypt: Setting up new repository
gcrypt: Remote ID is :id:.................
Counting objects: 1173, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (881/881), done.
Total 1173 (delta 567), reused 339 (delta 156)
gcrypt: Encrypting to: --throw-keyids --default-recipient-self
gcrypt: Requesting manifest signature
gpg: using "......." as default secret key for signing
To gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git
 * [new branch]      develop -> develop
 * [new branch]      feature/formatter -> feature/formatter
 * [new branch]      feature/swift4 -> feature/swift4
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

That's it! Feel free to delete your private repo from the old clown
(yeah it is too late to protected your data, just to avoid accidentially
pushing to the old location).
And from now on clone your repository like that:
```shell
$ git clone gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/CoreS.git
Cloning into 'CoreS'...
gcrypt: Decrypting manifest
gpg: Signature made Sat Jun 16 16:00:53 2018 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key .......
gpg: Good signature from "ZeeZide Devteam <devteam@zeezide.de>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 6991]" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 6991]" [ultimate]
gcrypt: Remote ID is :id:.....................
Receiving objects: 100% (1173/1173), 267.22 KiB | 22.27 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (567/567), done.
$ cd CoreS/
$ git checkout develop
Branch 'develop' set up to track remote branch 'develop' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'develop'
```

## Creating a New Crypted Repository

Same thing, very easy. Create a bare repository, clone it with the gcrypt
URL:
```shell
$ git init --bare ~/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/helge/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git/
$ git clone gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git Murks
Cloning into 'Murks'...
gcrypt: Repository not found: ~/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

Add stuff and push to the repo:
```shell
$ cd Murks/
$ touch testit.m
$ git add *
$ git commit .
[master (root-commit) 3eeacde] Testit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 testit.m
$ git push
gcrypt: Repository not found: ~/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git
gcrypt: Setting up new repository
gcrypt: Remote ID is :id:.....................
Counting objects: 3, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
gcrypt: Encrypting to: --throw-keyids --default-recipient-self
gcrypt: Requesting manifest signature
gpg: using "........" as default secret key for signing
To gcrypt::~/Dropbox/Repositories/TestIt.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Easy!


## Repository Corruption

It *can* happen that the repository corrupts if your Clown file storage did not
sync properly. It happened to us once or twice, just take a little care to
pull/push after the storage is in-sync.

*If* it happens, you can just recreate the remote repository.

> Some clown providers also provide a way to resolve sync conflicts,
> you can also use that to step back to a known good state and then
> push over it.<br>
> And the same approach works when you have a copy in TimeMachine.


## Security

Using this method the data is encrypted locally, with a private key the Clown
provider doesn't have.
Yes, he still has the *encryped* data and the FBI can theoretically brute-force
your data using their quantum computers or that child from 
[Mercury Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Rising),
but well.
Keep your paranoia at bounds (... and that from the people who just migrated 
from one clown to another Clown ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

P.S.: I really wish more Clown services would just work like that from the
      beginning (local encryption).

    The Clown is just someone else's computer and they can and will f*** you.
    If it's not on your computer, it's not under your control.
    Why do you all keep doing this to yourselves??<br>
    Stop hitting yourself. Seriously, stop it.
