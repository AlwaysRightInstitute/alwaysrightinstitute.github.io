Friday, time for a fun project!
Today we are going to bring 
[Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) (yes, that new Swift **server** framework)
to the mobile device.
Why? Because we can!
Along the way we disrupt Google search.
*Oh no. It is Monday only ...*

Last week we released a
[¬µTutorial on Swift NIO](/microexpress-nio/)
and built a small web framework as part of this,
[¬µExpress](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress).
End of last year we wrote a now-outdated
[tutorial](/http-010/) on the Swift Server API project.
Though the API used is outdated now,
it already contained our web-scale cow database 
and the Google-like search power to process it.<br>
Today we are combining the two to build something new.

Not interested to read? Just wanna see? At the bottom:

## Project Setup

> Update 2019-06-25: Xcode 11 now includes some Swift Package Manager support.
> This may or may not work with the SwiftXcode setup described here. So for
> now consider this Xcode 10 only ;-)

<a href="https://swiftxcode.github.io" target="extlink"><img src="http://zeezide.com/img/SwiftXcodePkgIcon.svg"
     align="right" width="86" height="86" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" /></a>
Instead of fiddling around with Swift Package Manager,
we use 
[swift xcode](https://swiftxcode.github.io)
to setup NIO within Xcode.
Go grab [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it yet, and install
[swift xcode](https://swiftxcode.github.io)
using:

```shell
brew install swiftxcode/swiftxcode/swift-xcode
swift xcode link-templates
```

(you can also install the [Swift NIO image](https://github.com/SwiftXcode/SwiftNIO_XcodeImage),
 to conveniently play w/ regular NIO servers).

Within Xcode, create a new project (‚åò-Shift-N),
go to the "iOS" section and select the "Swift Package Manager App"
template (do not use "macOS/Swift NIO", which is for regular, non-iOS servers):

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/01-wizard-spm-app.png" 
  /></center>

In the Project options, select the "Use the SPM 'cows' module." option:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/03-wizard-spm-2.png" 
  /></center>

Select a place where you want to store it, build the project (‚åò-b) and 
off we go.

### Import NIO in Package.swift

Next we need to tell Xcode / the Swift Package Manager that we want to use 
[Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
and 
[¬µExpress](https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress).
Open the `Package.swift` file and add the necessary package references.
**Do not forget to add the packages to the `dependencies` of the target itself**.
It should look like this:


```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MobileCows",

    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git",
                 from: "1.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/NozeIO/MicroExpress.git",
                 .branch("branches/swift-nio-lib"))
    ],

    targets: [
        .target(name: "MobileCows", 
                dependencies: [
                  "cows", "MicroExpress"
                ],
                path: ".")
    ]
)
```

MicroExpress pulls in NIO as a dependency. You can, but you don't have to,
import NIO explicitly.

Build the project (‚åò-b) again. This will take a moment (one time process) as it 
fetches the NIO, MicroExpress and Cows packages from the Internet and then
builds them.

OK, we are good to go!


## Scale it up! Add a Swift NIO server to the App.

What we are going to do is host a Swift NIO server within our iOS application.
When the app finished launching, we are going to bring up our NIO server.

At the top of the `AppDelegate.swift` file, import MicroExpress: 
```swift
// File: AppDelegate.swift

import MicroExpress
```

Add this code to the `application(didFinishLaunching...)` method:
```swift
// File: AppDelegate.swift

func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions 
                   opts: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool
{
    let app = Express()
  
    app.get("/") { req, res, _ in
        res.send("Hello World")
    }
    
    Thread.detachNewThread {
        app.listen(1337)
    }
  
    return true
}
```

We setup an `Express` application,
check [¬µTutorial on Swift NIO](/microexpress-nio/) to see how this works and
builds on top of Swift NIO.<br>
Afterwards we add a route, which responds to a `GET` HTTP request hitting the 
server root. Right now, we just send back a `"Hello World"`.

Then we do something wasteful to please our ¬µExpress API (we can do better).
Since the call to `listen(port)` will block (forever), 
we run it in a background thread.
This thread won't actually do anything but wait for the NIO server to finish.

OK, great. If you want, you can start your app and access the server.
The UI of the iOS app itself is still empty, but you can see that the server
launched on the device in the console:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/run-4-mark.png" 
  /></center>

And, even better, you can already access the server using a browser!
If you are on the simulator, you can just access it via:
[http://[::1]:1337/](http://[::1]:1337/).
If you are running on device, you need to figure out the IP address of your
device, and you can do the same:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/25-run-6-firefox.png" 
  /></center>

What we have here is a Swift NIO based HTTP server,
directly running on an iOS device!

> I hope I don't break any NDAs by revealing this:
> Few know it, but **i**Cloud was named **i**Cloud because the service runs on
> returned **i**Phones with broken displays. 
> Usually too expensive to repair, Apple is serious in its environmental efforts

> (this is also the reason why iCloud used to be a little slow,

> And what software enables that? Swift NIO of course.


## Let the App have a UI

On the go, we don't want to open our ChromeBook to access our server.
So lets add a UI to our app, which can target the server.
We keep it very simple and use a 
[WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)
as our main driver.

Open your `Main.storyboard` file, and
drag a WebKit View (WKWebView) into your View Controller:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/33-storyboard-wkwebview-dropped.png" 
  /></center>

Resize the view, so that it matches the blue page guides,
then use the triangle button and select "Add Missing Contraints".
Which, conincidentially, will add missing constraints.

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/storyboard-wkwebview-sized-add.png" 
  /></center>

To create an outlet to the WebView in our View Controller,
open the Assistant Editor (using the two "rings" in the toolbar).
Then Control-Drag from the WebView to the source file to create the outlet:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/storyboard-connect-create-name-drag.png"
  /></center>

Leave the Assistant Editor, open the `ViewController.swift`.
It now has the instance variable pointing to the WebView.
Xcode is also showing an error: We need to import `WebKit` in the 
View Controller:

```swift
// File: ViewController.swift - add somewhere at the top

import WebKit
```

Excellent. Almost there. What we want next is that the View Controller is
going to show our web page when it is displayed. To do this, we override
the `viewWillAppear` method:

```swift
// File: ViewController.swift - add this method to the class

override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
  super.viewWillAppear(animated)
  
  let url = URL(string: "http://[::1]:1337/")!
  let req = URLRequest(url: url)
  self.webView?.load(req)
}
```

The code is straightforward.
We create a URL pointing to our server
(running on the IPv6 "localhost address"),
we create a URLRequest targetting that URL,
and then we tell the WebView to execute the
URLRequest.<br>
Go ahead! Build and run the project. The app will start up and the
"Hello World" sent by our server will show up:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/51-load-url-run.png"
  /></center>

<center style="margin-top: 2em;"><b><i>SWEET SUCCESS!</i></b></center>

The device runs the server, and it runs a web browser hitting that server.
In an incredibly scalable way.
At this point we are essentially done,
but we want to add our award-winning webscale cow database.


## Cows, lotta Cows üêÑüêÇüêÑ

Let's beef it up, and compete against Google on search - right on the device!
In a first step, we are going to wrap a webscale cows database in
a MicroExpress HTTP endpoint.

Make sure to import the awesome `cows` module at the top:

```swift
// File: AppDelegate.swift - put somewhere at the top

import UIKit
import MicroExpress
import cows // <-- add this
```

Adjust the middleware code in `AppDelegate.swift` to match this:

```swift
// File: AppDelegate.swift - adjust the launch-method

let app = Express()

app.use(querystring)

app.get("/") { req, res, _ in
  let q = req.param("q")?.lowercased() ?? ""
  
  let cow = q.isEmpty
    ? vaca()
    : (allCows.first(where: { $0.lowercased().contains(q) })
       ?? "No such cow")
  
  return res.render("index", [ "cow": cow ])
}
```

Before our own route runs, make sure to hook up the
`querystring` middleware, which is part of ¬µExpress
(here is how it works: [¬µTutorial on Swift NIO](/microexpress-nio/#step-4-reusable-middleware)).
That middleware parses "query parameters" in the URL passed to the server,
for example:<br>
<center><pre>http://x:1337/?q=Hello</pre></center>
In that `q` is the name of the query parameter,
and `Hello` the value associated with it.

Looking at the handler function we do those steps:

- We grab the query parameter `q`, lowercase it for search.
  If there was no query parameter, we use the empty string.
- We check if the query parameter is empty,
  - if so: we generate a random cow via `vaca()`
  - otherwise, we search whether any cow matches the string and return it.
  - In case none matched, we return "No such cow"
- Then we tell the response to render the `index` Mustache template,
  and we pass over the `cow` we found using the advanced search algorithm
  above.
  
> You can build, but you can't run.

You probably noticed already: What is that "index" Mustache template
we try to render? We don't have that yet!
(We added [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) support to ¬µExpress
in yet another [tutorial](/microexpress-nio-templates/).)

Add the template. Create a `templates` directory alongside your sources:

<center><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/74-template-newdir.png"
  /></center>

Put the new `index.mustache` file into it:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html>
  <!-- File: templates/index.mustache -->
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport"
          content="user-scalable=no,
                   initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1,
                   width=device-width">
    <style>
      body { font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif; }
      h1 {
        color:           rgb(2, 123, 227);
        border-bottom:   1px solid rgb(2, 123, 227);
        padding-bottom:  0.1em;
        text-align:      center;
        font-size:       2em;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Mobile Cows</h1>

    <center>
      <form action="/" method="get">
        Find Beef: <input name="q" placeholder="e.g. 'compiler'"><br/>
        <a href="/">Feeling cowly!</a>
      </form>
    </center>

    <pre>{{cow}}</pre>
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is some "mobile HTML" boilerplate, including some CSS to make it look
nice.
The body of the page contains a regular HTML form to enable our cowsy search
functionality
and a link to generate random cows.
Finally it contains the Mustache marker 
`{% raw %}{{cow}}{% endraw %}`
to render the cow  we pass in
via:
```swift
res.render("index", [ "cow": cow ])
```

Thats it! Build and run, and access vast amounts of beef delivered in a
web-scale way using Swift NIO:

  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nio-on-the-client/84-finals.png"
  /></center>


## Finishing Up

Really the only thing you still have to do before submitting a competitor to
[ASCII Cows](http://zeezide.com/en/products/asciicows/index.html)
to the App Store is an icon.
Done.


## Technical Notes

### Client Side Swift NIO

Swift NIO is not only useful for writing server side code, but you can also
use it to build network clients. Like an IRC or IMAP4 client.<br />

Be careful with that for now! Even though we never experienced that in the
wild w/ GCD, using Swift NIO might not activate the necessary phone
radios to get Internet access.<br />
Checkout [swift-nio #130](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/130)
if you are interested in the details.

### iOS Multi-Tasking

The demo above actually does not work properly in the context of multi-tasking.
If the user puts the app in the background, the kernel will eventually reclaim
the port the server is listening on.
So if you actually want to do something like above for whatever reason
(maybe a Pied Piper competitor),
you need to tear down the server when the app goes into background,
and you need to rebind/listen the server when the app is coming back
to the foreground.<br>
Also, you probably want to use a kernel assigned port, instead of using a
hardcoded one.

Checkout the iOS networking articles on the details!

### WebKit / Server Race

It may be obvious, but there is actually a race between the server starting
up and the WebView being loaded.
That is, the server might not be running yet when the WebView hits the local
URL. Fortunately NIO startup is much faster than WebKit startup here,
so it doesn't matter for the demo.
