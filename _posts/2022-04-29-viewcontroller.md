Overall 
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) 
has been well received after its introduction.
However, something most developers stumble upon quickly is how to
structure non-trivial applications.
One option is to just stick to MVC and get a reasonably clean architecture
that isn't full of hacks.

When asked about the architecture to use with SwiftUI
([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller),
 [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel), 
 [Viper](https://www.raywenderlich.com/8440907-getting-started-with-the-viper-architecture-pattern), 
 [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) â€¦),
Apple at the WWDC 2021 essentially said: **Use whatever you like!**<br>
Which, while more guidance would be helpful, actually makes sense. 
SwiftUI doesn't force the developer into "MVC" in the same way UIKit did,
it provides the primitives to implement very different architectures.
Now that we aren't forced to use MVC anymore, we might start to like it ðŸ¤“

This is how we do it:
```swift
class HomePage: ViewController {
  
  // MARK: - Actions
  
  func showPreferences() {
    present(Preferences())
  }
  
  // MARK: - View
  
  var view : some View {
    Button(action: self.showPreferences) {
      Label("Preferences", systemImage: "gear")
    }
  }
}
```

> ViewControllers are like freaking zombies. Just won't die, 
> no matter how many times you shoot it [â€¦], or douse it in 
> gasoline and light it on fire, or anything.

We at the ARI think that SwiftUI is just another iteration of 
[WebObjects](/wo-intro/).
And hence structure SwiftUI apps in a similar way we used to.
After bringing a 
[few SwiftUI applications](https://zeezide.de/en/products/products.html) 
to the AppStore,
that turned out to work really well for us.

<center><a href="/wo-intro"
  ><img src=
  "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swiftobjects/MVC.png" 
  /></a></center>

No package/framework is needed at all to implement this!
Though we _will_ present a small one to assist the approach: called
[ViewController](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController),
a set of conveniences and "Ah, that I understand" stuff.

## The Problem

Simple things are astonishingly simple to create in SwiftUI. But as soon as
even trivial things like a master-detail setups come into play,
developers seem to forget clean architectures they practiced for years.
Instead come up with a mess of 
[`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)'s 
carrying state around, duplicating data, hack-patching and
breaking encapsulation on the way.

Something that can be seen a lot is a setup like this 
(cows module [over here](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows)):
```swift
import SwiftUI
import cows // @AlwaysRightInstitute

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      CowsOverview()
    }
  }
}

struct CowsOverview: View {

  @StateObject private var viewModel = CowsViewModel()

  var body: some View {
    List(viewModel.cows, id: \.self) { cow in
      Text(verbatim: cow)
        .font(.body.monospaced())
    }
    .searchable(text: $viewModel.search)
    .navigationTitle("Cows Overview")
  }
}

class CowsViewModel: ObservableObject {
  
  @Published var cows   = allCows
  @Published var search = "" {
    didSet { 
      cows = allCows.filter { search.isEmpty || $0.contains(search) } 
    }
  }
}
```

Reasonably clean, the logic is pulled out of the `View` to not end up with a
_Massive View_ and to make it testable.
Looks like this:

> Talking about "ViewModels". 
> This seems to be very common terminology for this thing in the SwiftUI world.
> We are not entirely sure why, those things seem quite different to

> <br>
> We call them ViewController's, because that is
> what they do, they control the view holding a reference to them.
> Everyone is welcome to replace "ViewController" with "ViewModel"
> when reading this article.

### Master Detail

Things start to get interesting (and problematic) when some kind of
"navigation" is added to the application,
e.g. showing a certain detail view when selecting a cow
(could also be in a 
[sheet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:))
or 
[NavigationView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview), 
we use an inline presentation for the example).

**WARNING: Incorrect Code**:
What people often try first:
```swift
struct CowDetail: View {

  @ObservedObject var viewModel : CowDetailViewModel

  init(cow: String) { // ugh ugly
    _viewModel = ObservedObject(wrappedValue: CowDetailViewModel(cow: cow))
  }

  var body: some View {
    Text(verbatim: viewModel.cow)
      .font(.body.monospaced())
      .navigationTitle("Cow Detail")
  }
}
class CowDetailViewModel: ObservableObject {
  
  @Published var cow = ""
  init(cow: String) { self.cow = cow }
}
```
And tracking the selection in the `CowsOverview`:
```swift
struct CowsOverview: View {

  @StateObject private var viewModel = CowsViewModel()

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      if let cow = viewModel.selectedCow {
        CowDetail(cow: cow)
        Text("Selection")
          .font(.footnote)
        Divider()
      }
      
      List(viewModel.cows, id: \.self) { cow in
        Button(action: { viewModel.selectedCow = cow }) {
          Text(verbatim: cow)
            .font(.body.monospaced())
        }
      }
    }
    .searchable(text: $viewModel.search)
    .navigationTitle("Cows Overview")
  }
}

class CowsViewModel: ObservableObject {
  
  @Published var search = "" {
    didSet { cows = allCows.filter { search.isEmpty || $0.contains(search) } }
  }
  @Published var cows = allCows
  
  @Published var selectedCow : String?
}
```
**WARNING: Incorrect Code**.

Strange things will happen, it has at least two issues:
- [`@ObservedObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/observedobject)
  doesn't "own" the object, so it might actually go away (because the parent
  also doesn't hold a reference to it, it is View-local, but only has storage
  for [the OO's Publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject/objectwillchange-2oa5v) 
  assigned).
- A new instance of the `CowDetailViewModel` is created everytime the body
  of the parent view refreshes.
  (This very often results in confusion. Remember that a View's body can be
   evaluated arbitrary number of times as the framework sees fit.)
  
Using a
[`@StateObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stateobject)
addresses parts of the issue:
```swift
struct CowDetail: View {
  @StateObject var viewModel : CowDetailViewModel
  init(cow: String) { // ugh ugly
    _viewModel = .init(wrappedValue: CowDetailViewModel(cow: cow))
  }
```
Slightly better. This will make sure that the `CowDetail` View (i.e. someone)
is actually going to own the associated ViewModel.
<br>
But now a funny thing happens when another cow is selected:
Nothing happens in the UI, the selection sticks to the first selected cow.

<center><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vc/05-cows-selection.png"
  ><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vc/05-cows-selection.png" style="max-height: 20em;" /></a></center>

Click another cow, the displayed selection won't ever change anymore.
Why is that, the `selectedCow` in the parent ViewModel is properly updating,
the `CowDetail` is re-initialized?
<br>
The reason is that for a `StateObject` the `wrappedValue` closure only runs 
once, if the state is first initialized. All subsequent calls to `init`
will just drop the input on the floor.

Often people do a hodgepodge of different hacks to address that, 
but let's look at a common one:
```swift
struct CowDetail: View {

  @StateObject var viewModel : CowDetailViewModel
  
  let cow : String
  
  init(cow: String) {
    self.cow = cow
    _viewModel = .init(wrappedValue: CowDetailViewModel(cow: cow))
  }

  var body: some View {
    Text(verbatim: viewModel.cow)
      .font(.body.monospaced())
      .navigationTitle("Cow Detail")
      .onChange(of: cow) { newCow in viewModel.cow = newCow }
  }
}
```
That actually works.
- Introduces a copy of the cow as an instance variable in the View itself.
- If the `View` is refreshed, the value of `cow` will update using the `init`
  (the VM closure will still get created and dropped w/o being used).
- And if the `View`'s `cow` ivar changed, 
  the new value is (manually) pushed into the "ViewModel"

But, jeez, is that stuff ugly! 
Overriding View init's,
creating a property wrapper copy and push it into the state 
(capturing a closure each time!),
duplicating all input in instance variables for API purposes,
manual tracking of arbitrary values (imagine the VM has more than one property),
â€¦<br>
Something is clearly going wrong here, there has to be a better way!

## A Solution: Model View Controller

A solution is nothing fancy or complicated, 
but just sticking to what was best practice in UIKit already:
keep state out of `View`'s.

Instead of having the `View`'s own the ViewModels,
a ViewController 
(again, feel free to call them ViewModels)
hierarchy is formed. It is just "drawn" by the `View`'s.
The `View`'s sole two purposes: rendering and event handling.

Lets see what we mean using our cows example app. Again, this doesn't require
any library or framework and all apps we deploy today just use the concept,
not even
[ViewController](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController)
(yet).

```swift
class CowDetail: ObservableObject {

  @Published var cow = ""
  
  init(cow: String) { self.cow = cow }
  
  struct ContentView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var viewController : CowDetail
    
    var body: some View {
      Text(verbatim: viewController.cow)
        .font(.body.monospaced())
        .navigationTitle("Cow Detail")
    }
  }
}
```

It is almost the same like the "problematic approach" shown above, 
just the "other way around".
Solving a ton of problems and requiring zero SwiftUI hack-a-rounds.

- The `CowDetail` is now an 
  [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject)
  representing that section of the screen,
  a "ViewController".
- Things you'd put into View
  [`@State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) before,
  become
  [`@Published`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published)
  properties of the controller.
  Because no state belongs into Views.
- The sample contains the `ContentView` as a subtype of the `CowDetail` 
  controller.
  That's fine for simple setups, in real apps it isn't unusual to put them into 
  separate files that are concerned only about a specific representation
  (e.g. like Storyboards before).
  There can be multiple "ContentViews", e.g. for different themes,
  device sizes or types.
- The associated `View` is receiving its controller as an
  [`@ObservedObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/observedobject).
  This is fine in this case, because the ViewController hierarchy now 
  explictly owns the chained controllers:
  
```swift
class CowsOverview: ObservableObject {

  @Published var search = "" {
    didSet { cows = allCows.filter { search.isEmpty || $0.contains(search) } }
  }
  @Published var cows = allCows
  
  @Published var detailViewController : CowDetail?
  
  // MARK: - Actions
  
  func showDetail(_ cow: String) {
    detailViewController = CowDetail(cow: cow)
  }
  
  // MARK: - View

  struct ContentView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var viewController : CowsOverview
    
    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        if let presentedViewController = viewController.detailViewController {
          CowDetail.ContentView(viewController: presentedViewController)
          Text("Selection")
            .font(.footnote)
          Divider()
        }
        
        List(viewController.cows, id: \.self) { cow in
          Button(action: { viewController.showDetail(cow) }) {
            Text(verbatim: cow)
              .font(.body.monospaced())
          }
        }
      }
      .searchable(text: $viewController.search)
      .navigationTitle("Cows Overview")
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how the `CowsOverview` is now owning the `CowDetail`.
Very similar to how a 
[`presentingViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621430-presentingviewcontroller)
is owning the
[`presentedViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621407-presentedviewcontroller)
in UIKit.

This call initiates the presentation:
```swift
func showDetail(_ cow: String) {
  // like `self.present(CowDetail(cow: cow))` in UIKit
  detailViewController = CowDetail(cow: cow)
}
```

Just sticking to this pattern produces reasonably clean SwiftUI application.
It takes out the uglyness of the "problematic solution" where Views and state
intermingle:
- Views can use
  [`@ObservedObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/observedobject),
  because it is clear who owns the associated object (ViewController).
- There is no capturing of unused state initializers anymore.
- A single source of truth, no duplicated state in Views, no watching and
  synchronization of local values.
- No ugly `_` propery wrapper inits anymore (would be nice to have synthesized
  class inits in Swift though).

There is one minor thing missing. The "Root ViewController" needs to be setup.
That is the sole place where we still use a
[`@StateObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stateobject):
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  
  @StateObject var sceneViewController = CowsOverview()
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      CowsOverview.ContentView(viewController: sceneViewController)
    }
  }
}
```

We tend to call that `ContentView` in the main SwiftUI application
the "Scene View".
Each scene should have an own root, as the user might navigate
differently through each one.



## ViewController

<a href="https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController" target="zz"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vc/ViewControllerIcon256.png"
     align="right" width="86" height="86" style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;" /></a>
Using the general approach shown is usually fine for most apps.
But sometimes there are a lot of pages with many different presentations,
navigation, sheets, etc.
So we came up with
[ViewController](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController),
a reasonably small library formalizing the concept a little.
It can be added as a Swift package to an Xcode project:

Package URL: `https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController.git`

The main thing it adds is the
[`ViewController`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/develop/Sources/ViewController/ViewController.swift)
protocol,
which is derived from
[ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject).
The VC variant of the `CowDetail` component:
```swift
import ViewController

class CowDetail: ViewController {

  @Published var cow : String
  
  init(cow: String) { self.cow = cow }

  var view: some View {
    Text(verbatim: cow)
      .font(.body.monospaced())
      .navigationTitle("Cow Detail")
  }
}
```
Pretty similar to a SwiftUI
[`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view),
but with an important distinction:
It has a proper object identity and can track (and own!) the presentation of
other `ViewController`'s.

The library supports both, directly embedding the associated View construction
as shown above or using an own ContentView type. The latter either inline
or as a separate top-level type.
<br>
`CowsOverview` with an explicit `ContentView`:
```swift
class CowsOverview: ViewController {

  @Published var search = "" {
    didSet { cows = allCows.filter { search.isEmpty || $0.contains(search) } }
  }
  @Published var cows = allCows

  // MARK: - Actions

  func showDetail(_ cow: String) {
    present(CowDetail(cow: cow))
  }
  
  // MARK: - View

  struct ContentView: View {
    
    @EnvironmentObject var viewController : CowsOverview
    
    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        List(viewController.cows, id: \.self) { cow in
          Button(action: { viewController.showDetail(cow) }) {
            Text(verbatim: cow)
              .font(.body.monospaced())
          }
        }
      }
      .searchable(text: $viewController.search)
      .navigationTitle("Cows Overview")
    }
  }
}
```
The active `ViewController` 
[can be acquired](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/ViewControllerEnvironment.swift#L74) 
using the SwiftUI environment,
using either its concrete type, or the 
[`AnyViewController`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/AnyViewController.swift)
type-erased version.
<br>
This makes splitting up the `ContentView` into specific subviews easy
and straight forward.

Note how the `showDetail` action is calling 
[`.present`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/ViewController.swift#L207).
This will push the detail to the ViewController stack and present the
cow in a sheet. No manual tracking of the presented ViewController is
necessary anymore (though it still can be done if desirable).
<br>
The framework is keeping track of the presentation stack,
and makes it accessible using the old school
`presentingViewController` and `presentedViewController`
accessors.

There is one final piece to get things going, the root `sceneViewController`
needs to be setup. There are two ways to do it, the plain version:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  
  @StateObject var sceneViewController = CowsOverview()
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      sceneViewController.view // Or: CowsOverview.ContentView()
        .controlled(by: sceneViewController) // activate
    }
  }
}
```
Or using a small helper `View` which does the same,
[`MainViewController`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/MainViewController.swift#L11):
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      MainViewController(CowsOverview())
    }
  }
}
```

We think that this looks quite pretty!


### NavigationController

Calling `present` (in auto mode) is always going to present a ViewController in 
a 
[sheet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:)).
[`ViewController`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/develop/Sources/ViewController/ViewController.swift)
also provides
[`show`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/ViewController.swift#L215)
(and technically `showDetail`, though the `SplitViewController` is not finished 
 yet).
 
When using `show` the presentation can adapt to the container view it is in
(i.e. the container view gets a chance to decide on the presentation).
<br>
If a 
[`NavigationController`](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/ContainerViewControllers/NavigationController.swift#L106) is used,
`show` will result in a navigation transition, instead of a sheet.
How a ViewController is presented is transparent to it
(the current mode 
[can be queried](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController/blob/15ea3d3a702cb9b27ca6de6a6b0c0d4505036836/Sources/ViewController/Presentations/PresentationMode.swift#L99)
from the environment).

To wrap up, this is how an automatic `show` version looks like:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  
  var body: some View {
    MainViewController(
      NavigationController(rootViewController: CowsOverview())
    )
  }
}
```
And instead of `present` the action should use `show`:
```swift
func showDetail(_ cow: String) {
  show(CowDetail(cow: cow))
}
```
In case you wonder, this also works:
```swift
func showDetail(_ cow: String) {
  let detail = CowDetail(cow: cow)
  detail.modalPresentationStyle = .navigation // .sheet, .custom, â€¦
  present(detail)
}
```


## Closing Notes

We meant to write about this, and formalize it in a small package,
for quite a while (by now years, actually ðŸ™ˆ).
The presented [solution](#a-solution-model-view-controller) is used in various
of our apps in the AppStore.
<br>
[ViewController](https://github.com/ZeeZide/ViewController) isn't deployed
yet, 
but was created for a more complex application w/ multiple, stacked
presentations going on. We quite like it.

Note that this doesn't fix programmatic SwiftUI navigation
(aka "deep linking"),
which still happens to be a mess today.
