Hello everyone: In case you didn't notice yet, the ARI co-founded a new
project, which we happen to call [**Noze.io**](http://noze.io/).

Noze.io is [SwiftSockets](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/SwiftSockets/)
on steroids. It implements a lot of Node.js concepts in Swift.
Does that make sense? You tell us! :-)
The core are non-blocking, evented streams driven by GCD channels (or any other
asynchronous input).

Noze.io code looks a lot like Node code:

    http.createServer { req, res in 
      res.writeHead(200, [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
      res.end("<h1>Hello World</h1>")
    }
    .listen(1337)

Streams can be used to setup processing streams, such as:

    spawn("git", "log", "-100", "--pretty=format:%H|%an|<%ae>|%ad")
      | readlines
      | through2(linesToRecords)
      | through2(recordsToHTML)
      | response

The project is still in its early stages but already comes with a lot of
[modules](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Sources)
and 
[samples](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples)
to play with.
We think it is a nice project you might wanna try, so don't waste any time
and head over to [**Noze.io**](http://noze.io/)!
